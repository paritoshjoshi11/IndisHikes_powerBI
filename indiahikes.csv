It was great experience in trekking with IH team. Thanks for providing great Logistical support. I felt safe and secure with IH team.
Team took care of providing good food all the time.
Sometime team is extremely exhausted and feels unable to participate additional activities as part of IH experience or sometime team is required to move quickly after a day hike. I feel like little bit of relaxation or re-organizing the time for such things would help team to recover better and participate in activities better way. Though experience in this trek was far better then my previous IH trek,
Green trails is nice idea by IH team and it will definitely help others to understand and adopt learning given by green trail initiative back in their city. I am mostly following in my regular life like saving water, less plastic use, recycle .
Experience co-coordinator is very good, supportive and quick is responding.
She was able to covey do or don'ts in trek efficient way and reduced all the questions about the trek.
Shweta is a great trek lead. I found her very supporting and understanding. She was managing team very well. She very kind and a good communicator. she understood all our concerns and acted very well.
- Regular health check
- Regular check with team regarding their health(if in case of any issues)
- Moral support to team during the trek
- Making sure no-one is left behind and feeling alone.

I have been trekking for many years now. Have done lots of jungle treks. But this trek has been really really different. Its a perfect package of jungle... Streams... Mystic village.... Sunrise....sunsets... Camp sites ...caves... Cooking food... This list is endless.
Things that needs to be changed. The intensity of the trek had to be difficult. First few treks has to be by invite only. 
Absolutely. Green trails is something i really value and totally believe. This initiative by India hike will definitely go a long way in keeping our mountains clean and healthy. I feel even a single wrapper brought back from the Mountain is worth the initiative.
I learnt loads of skills. 
Climbing the mountain with so much of weight.
Cooking our own food 
DIY trek ..is what I can do.
Got a first hand experience of managing the trek. 
Nandana has been very very helpful. She has been available at every shoutout...whether by mail... whatsapp or call. She had indepth knowledge of every stuff that we had discussion on. 
She was like a mother figure to the entire trek. 
Dhavval is gem of a person. Apart from being a wonderful trek lead he is a very genuine person. He is everready to help anyone at at any point of the day. 
During the trek, there were times when the decisions had to be changed... Or amended... But he used to be very calm and ever smiling.

To say the trek was magical is a small word. Being in this trek has helped me realise that this saying  "" Be the change you wish to see in the world"" is true, how India hikes was created, has been soaring and has been changing and impacting individuals is remarkable. It has instilled a positive feedback in me , that what we believe in and the change we wish to see in the world can be brought about by us.
The trek was amazing. The organisation of the whole trek right from the travel to the base camp is seamless. And your trek guides ( Swaradha , MJ , Jo) I must say handled all the moods of the people and nature that were thrown at them rather gracefully and that too at that altitude and those temperatures.
Green Trails is a philosophy all of us must believe in and must live by , I agree with you on this. I practice a sustainable lifestyle at home at least I thought I did until I experienced the degree of practices you follow at such environmental conditions and I realise that I definitely can up my efforts . And I am making changes in my lifestyle to be more sustainable.
A skill that I learnt was how to pack your backpack , and how to handle the trek poles. I also was observing how the guides almost like gazelles just glided through the paths when I was struggling to understand where to place a step, I realised the whole body posture helps in playing a role ( a video on how to descend by Swathi ) i recollected some tips and realised that they all fit the checklist the trek leaders were following, so putting into action what i saw and in-person and on the video helped a lot. I had close to no pain or cramps after the descent which is a miracle 
Prathima is our trek coordinator, she made the experience very welcoming and the ice breaker necessary befor embarking on a journey with complete strangers was done really well. 
Ms Swaradha , Mr Mrityunjay and Mr Jothi Rajan , they were our trek leaders , I mention them all because each of them showed different leadership qualities , they were amazing as a team as well.
Swaradha was committed to the trek not as an employee but as someone who loved trekking, so the trek did not seem like a task.
Mrityunjay was a epitome of calmness on summit day , as we were almost an hour behind and it was snowing pretty heavily. I was lagging the whole descent , he just trudged along and for once I did not feel that I'm lagging or in the last or left behind , that boosted my morale . I don't think I thanked him properly , if you can pass on the message Thank you Mrityunjay for boosting my morale.
Jothi Ranjan was a complete team player , he was present wherever help was needed , no matter what the work , be it digging the toilet pit or pitching the tents or capturing the most wonderful pictures .
In person and and as a team they were wonderful and delivered the spirit of India hikes , of what I have been seeing from the day I started browsing the website.

This being the first trek with IH, I am glad to share that it has been one of my best experience ever. The warmth and the care from the entire team had helped all the days on the trek to be wholesome. Starting from the punctuality, to food, from organization to the safety considerations, from the support to the fun part, IH had been very professional and also cooperative. In brief, it had been a great experience.
I strongly believe in the Green Trails initiative taken by IH. Back at home, I already preach this, use lesser plastics and make sure I reuse them in every possible manner. Before moving out to the mountains, I had been reading about all these on the website and had been so glad to know that I would be a part of this, and saving the mountains. Just keep doing this, and spreading the word. 
ques. Our trek leader Ankur had been extremely supportive to let us know how to go about things, how to get rid of the fear, the lack of knowledge, and also how to be mentally strong to handle any crisis situation. I learnt that one needs to be compact with their belongings, be ready for challenges as they come their way. Apart from this, being literal, I would say I have learnt the art of pitching and un-pitching the tents. 
Prathima, the experience Coordinator,  had been very supportive enough, pre as well as post trek. She had been very prompt, to answer to every question and query that I threw down to her at any time. She informed us in details, about the trek, the necessities, the requirements, the fitness regime, packing the belongings, as well as how to be mentally prepared. Even post trek, she was keen enough to communicate with everyone in the group, and acknowledge our experiences and thoughts. In one word, she was cooperative and warm in her approach.
Ankur had been my trek leader, and it had been a heart warming experience with him. He is a great person at heart, with a charming personality. He is extremely caring, enthusiastic, supportive and friendly, both with the kids as well as with the elders. Did not find him walking or running through the trails, he actually flies through them all, motivating the entire team throughout. Thanks to him for such an overwhelming experience, with awesome stories to learn from and learning to smile through it all. Missing the entire trek a way too much and specially the morning wakeup calls from him ;)

It was amazing every trek I do with IH just had it's own unique experience. Would really like to thank the operation team the back end team which we don't see in the camp site helping us throughout to get such a splendid experience.

6,Anupa Saxena,2021-10-01,Deoriatal - Chandrashila,"
My experience with IndiaHikes for the Deoriatal Chandrashila Trek was amazing and very memorable. I absolutely enjoyed the entire experience. Right from the time I signed up for the trek, IndiaHikes team provided detailed information like what to pack, how to build fitness for the trek etc. Once the trek started, I was impressed with the way the entire trek was organised - The regular health check-ups to monitor the trekkers' health; The selection of beautiful campsites and equally scenic trails; The delicious food preparations by the kitchen team - All these arrangements were amazing! 
I absolutely loved all the campsites - the Sari campsite with refreshing green paths against a backdrop of mountains, the Deoriatal campsite with views of snow-covered mountains, the Syalmi campsite with captivating sunset views, and the Baniyakund campsite with green meadows and dramatic skies. The views from the Chandrashila summit were magnificent; the feeling of watching these views is difficult to put into words. Various activities throughout the trek, like tree-hugging in the forest, drinking water directly from the stream, and penning down our thoughts right after the summit climb, made the trek even more valuable, and made me feel closer to nature. A huge thanks to the IndiaHikes trek team - Richa, Kuldeep, Anuj, the kitchen staff and the entire supporting team - for facilitating such a wonderful experience. 
I also liked the idea of having a debrief meeting after the trek; it gave us a chance to analyse how being close to nature made us feel. It was heartening to hear everyone's experiences and their take-aways from the trek.
The trek group was really nice as well; we all got along very well, and it was amazing to see how people were motivating each other. This trek has given me memories which I will cherish forever. I am glad to have been a part of this group.
I really liked the sustainable hand-washing practice using the hand-wash contraption. It does save a lot of water, compared to hand-wash using a tap!
I did learn some skills that would be useful in my future treks, like proper use of trekking pole, surgeon's knot for shoelaces, sustainable hand-washing and utensil-washing practices.
Our experience coordinator for the trek, Nandana, was very helpful in sharing all the required information before the trek started. We got to know a lot of information like what all things to pack, how to build fitness for the trek, and information about the trek itself. We also had a virtual meet-up with the team before the starting of the trek, which was helpful since we got to clarify our questions.
I am glad that Richa was was the Trek Leader of our trek. She managed the entire experience very well. She was very motivating and inspiring throughout the trek, and was always available whenever we needed any help. Seeing her passion for nature was very inspiring. I thoroughly enjoyed the activities she encouraged us to do like hugging the trees, and drinking water directly from the river.

It was one of a kind. There was high alert rains and landslides and trek had to be cut shot. 
But the way IndiaHikes team handled with such knowhow was so commendable. Hats of to the team Nishant, Abhishek and the entire team of trekkers and cooks who went great lengths to keep us safe and make sure we travelled back safely.
The food was excellent given the circumstances..there was no compromise.
We love you IndiaHikes, waiting to travel with my husband who could not make it this time with me 😊

This being my 1st trek with kids, i was amazed at the amount of security i felt when i left my kids responsibilities on you guys. During the complete accsend or descend  i didn't even know where my kids where but still was sure they'll be safe.

The trek has transported me to a different world, walking at my own pace devouring the ever-changing landscape of Dayara’s forest cover. As written by the co-founder Sandhya UC of IH, is all we have experienced. 
My very first trek at 63 years old, the oldest in the family trek team, was filled with bountiful energies provided by the 8 year olds. These little ones had no complaints absolutely, in eating whatever is offered and gadgets free days, is amazing.
A fantastic learning experience was provided by IH by its trek leader Aditya and his team. Completely new stranger families spent as one family in that week starting from 11th to 16th October 2021.
From ‘choice filled’ life to ‘no choice’ days needs to be experienced to know what it means. Thank you, Arjun for creating the “India Hikes” entity. 
Prathima has provided every bit that was needed before the trek and also has organized an online meeting to clear all doubts. A lot depends on the Coordinator to make it or get dropped. She did a good job.

The vision and values of IndiaHikes was experienced and I could really feel and live these through out the trek. It was indeed the best trekking experience that I have had. Our trek lead, was amazing in the way she led the team and lived these values in the true spirit. She connected well with each one of us and made it a superb experience over all.
 I am anyways a person that works on SWM issues in my community and locality here. It was amazing to see the green trail philosophy of leaving the trails better. Picking up small pieces of litter, segregate them at the end of the day, the bio toilets' etc. were an amazing experience and learning.

16,ROHIT KAUSHAL,2021-10-01,Sandakphu,"
The reason I trek with India hikes is for the experience which is beyond the physical experience of the trek. And this time too the experience was phenomenal, in fact the way the trek leads try to do different things for example writing a post card at the summit so that the trekkers retain the experience in their mind and soul + also to build the habit of reflection goes beyond the physical trekking experience, or the daily reflection exercise of drawing the mountain basis the experience was great. Kudos to the team, great job done by the trek lead on this trek
As already mentioned, trek leaders are what pull me to trek with India hikes. The way she created bonding with the group, the kind of experiences she curated for the team and the way she leads the team both with authority and care is inspiring to see in a girl at such a young age.

First of all experience from India Hikes was very safe! As I was a solo female trekker I was having a lot of doubts before coming to this trek how will be the arrangements, staying, food, safety, etc. Trek experience was like a lifetime achievement.
I think starting from the website details, each and every stay, food, trek leader, guides everyone played a very important role for us to complete the trek. The way of hospitality, their sweet behaviour, every place where we had lunch, I guess I was 100% clear in my mind that ya Iam safe here and I don't need to worry about myself as I am alone its like a complete family with me for 7 days. Go Rock INDIA HIKES, I will soon come for my next trek.

This was my first ever high altitude trek and first experience with Indiahikes and I thoroughly enjoyed it. It was not just a trek but an entire spectrum of emotions along the way. Every climb and ever ascent was worth the spectacular views that greeted us at the top. Our batch was the one of the most luckiest ones to get the clearest beautiful views of the four largest peaks.
 To summarize it was the most beautiful experience with unforgettable memories. I would wholly recommend everyone to go on such treks with Indiahikes including beginners and solo travelers, even females. It is completely safe and reliable.

Very well organized trek. Staff was accommodating, caring, well knowledgeable. We could sense elaborated planning behind this trip right from first day of base camp. Organizing every thing so neat and clean (also on time) is not easy job, so hats off  to you guys for your efforts.  
Food was great. It was not only tasty but also healthy. 
When we reached Raithal, Aditya came to welcome each one of us. At this point I was surprised to see amount of care he was showing. 
When we reached our rooms, we found personalized notes for each trekker which is so thoughtful. Aditya gave briefing of the trek on first day and already our kids were his little fans.
Aditya used to listen each and every person's concern very patiently and answer them. He would never miss to get back to you if he has said so. May be he has got his patience from those mountains. 
Other trek guides were equally helpful and patient.
Aditya handled atleast two medical situations during trek very efficiently. 
My kid definitely wants to trek with Adi Sir again.

I enjoyed my trekking experience with Indiahikes. This being my first full-fledged trek, my emotions were mixed. Fatigue and tiredness were combined with feelings of happiness and awe, watching the scenic beauty of Dayara Bugyal. If I have to sum it all up in a few words, I would call it a rich experience, which has given me a lot to ponder upon, in terms of being fit and healthy, and viewing life in a more sustainable and minimalistic way. 
Green Trails is a fantastic initiative. It was so encouraging to see all the kids taking on the mantle of Green Warriors and picking up trash during the trek. Having done a trek with Indiahikes, I am reminded of how many small things that we do without thinking can be done differently if we are conscious of managing as well as minimizing our waste to the extent possible.  
Apart from other things, for sure from now on, I will be more conscious while using wet wipes.

Overall , I am very satisfied with Indiahikes and would definitely participate in future treks organised by Indiahkes.
I really felt good to be part of 'eco friendly trek' group,
Special Thanks to Patanjali for making pick up time adjustments as I had missed my flight and was not able to make it on time.
Also , Moksh and his team did superb job making sure everyone was comfortable.

Yes , for sure , I am very much concerned about amount of plastic i am using on day to day to basis and there is always thought running in my mind - how can I reduce that .This has had very positive impact on my lifestyle :)
Yes , I read about DIY treks on IH website and plan to take one soon.
Being my first multi day trek - i learnt couple of things like how to use trek pole effectively , and pack backpack properly.
Patanjali has been really good in communicating everything related to the trek be it things to carry , weather updates , workout routine to follow , covid related guidelines and he was always available to answer any questions .
Moksh has been really awesome in way he managed the trek , when he said that this was his first batch as trek leader and first time doing goechala trek , I thought may be he would be rusty .But I was totally wrong as he exceeded the expectations and managed it really well and we felt very fortunate to have calm and matured trek leader in Moksh.
I would definitely would be willing to do more treks with Moksh as trek leader.

I have been hiking/trekking for 7 years, always organizing myself with small group of 3-7 friends. I was always critical of larger groups as it adds to the obligation, planning, etc. Rupin being my first trek with Indiahikes, gave me a new perspective that the trek can be beautiful even in a group, as large as 24. 
Some of the key highlights were - camp sites that was meticulously chosen to have a great view; food designed diligently to balance the right amount of nutrition; trail to have right amount of acclimatisation and mix of easy and difficult routes; and most importantly people, who took care of everything and everyone constantly motivating and inspiring each other. 
I came alone for the trek, but I am carrying back some beautiful memories with folks whom I can call friends and family now.

Amazing in one word, you get to learn and understand so much more than just walking the trail associated with a trek.
Not yet it's only been a week back but there has been a definite impact. From the thought and consciousness of living a minimal lifestyle, developing sustainable habits, and doing small things such as carrying a sustainability kit, saying no to plastic, and goods that come in plastic, doing proper waste segregation at home. I Will surely put in the effort to improve my day-to-day life in a while.
From measuring  health vitals such as blood pressure and the impact of blood oxygen levels, to properly use a sleeping bag, understanding packing a backpack with the minimal necessary equipment, charting reading and narrating a navigation map, getting a sense of the weather from the cloud formations, understanding the various layers of a tent. The experience was really enriching.
The experience coordinator was good, providing valuable information on a wide range of queries. Also passing information via mail regularly and coordinating between the group well before the trek.
The most amazing Trek Leader on can hope for. Energetic, passionate, knowledgable, and a thorough professional. From the first moment of greet to everyone reaching the campsite the sense of positivity could be felt. 
The continuous effort to educate the trekkers about the responsibilities, like maintaining and helping to keep the mountains clean, maintaining hygiene at campsites , being collaborative and respectful to others. 
Making sure everyone takes enough time to enjoy the trail and not only get lost in capturing the moments digitally, to remind us to sit down spend sometime with ourselves was such a caring gesture. 
The most amazing aspect though was the ability to never forget and always arrange the small things, the things that matter the most, and get lost in all the rush and mush of other things, by getting the team involved in small games/activities daily, even more than once at times. It was such a dedicated gesture towards the involvement with the trekkers, to make the trekkers a family.
Last but not least the utmost care and every vigilance about the safety and health vitals of the trekkers made us feel so comfortable and safe on the journey.
Would not hesitate ever to go on the trek with our trek leader Shradha, on any trail.
I would also like to take a moment to appreciate our local guides Uttam Sir and Vicky sir for being part of the wonderful experience :)

It was just amazing experience.. 
Unbelievable.. Despite unpredicted weather conditions we trekked to the top successfully. Could not imagine how the trek will be amidst bitter cold weather, heavy rain, and bad weather. 
Felt amazed to see the beauty of nature, dense forests, meadows, grand mountains. 
It was first time experience to trek with Indiahikes organisation. Really fantastic. The dishes provided to us were delicious and tasty, thanks to the kitchen staff.
Would like to trek with Indiahikes again for the next time.
A big thank you ..!!:) :)
As this trek made me memorable and cherished forever. Will never forget this memorable experience in my lifetime..
Yes the Green trails help to keep the nature beautiful and clean so that the future generations can enjoy the beauty of nature .. It motivated us to keep the mountains in good condition and clean. It was a great idea that ecobags were provided to each and everyone during the trek so that the wastes can be collected.  Will also keep practicing this to keep our surrounding environment clean and better condition. A big thank you to Indiahikes for adopting the green trails for each and every treks.
Lets go GREEEN ..!! and let us keep the Mother earth clean and healthy.
Say big NO to plastic.
Yes learned a lot from high altitude trekking. It was my first high altitude trek experience with Indiahikes.
The trekking gives us time for reflection which significantly improves the decision making abilities. It improves the overall fitness.  One can spend some time on trails, climbing around the boulders, rock hopping and ascending hills to get a whole body workout, to improve strength, agility and cardio fitness.
Exposing to nature helps in reducing stress and anxiety.
learned so many things like when to plan for trek, how to prepare itinerary, setting goals, how to adapt to change and develop the mental strength. Also learned to get mentally prepare to trek more and more , push myself ahead, ignore the pains and sickness to observe more, feel more, see more the beauty of things around and connect with the nature and mountains. 
Just start with venturing out, see how far I can get , improve my abilities and keep going ... !!
Of course Experience coordinators definitely play a very important role .. 
Expressing  gratitude to Ms Pratima Chabria, Mr Patanjali Bhat and some coordinators who I miss to name, for providing the valuable tips/advices to get prepared, to keep mentally and physically fit for the trek and for answering the queries provided by the trekkers. Without them it wud not have been possible to complete the trek..
And also thanks to the coordinators who kept updating to us regarding knowledge and information about the trek, fitness details through the mails. 
I owe a big thanks to our trek leader Akshay Aralikatti for making the trek successful and thanks to our team for the love and support.
The tips/advices given to us by the him bfore the trek, during the trek were helpful. He is a passionate trekker so it was wonderful experience to learn things from him. Had lots of fun during the trek.
The support shown by the trek leader is appreciable. 
Huge thanks to AKSHAY ARALIKATTI .. !! would love to trek with you again.

I had a great and holistic experience, not only for the trek itself but to make the mountains cleaner than we found it. Our TL encouraged we trek as a team and look out for each other every step of the way.
Our trek leader Dushaynt was great, sharing many practical tips which only come from his vast experience. Most of the other support stuff was great as well, including food, warm drinking water, sleeping bags/lining etc.
One area of improvement - some of the tent zippers did not work properly, letting cold air in throughout the night. Would be good to maintain the zippers in good working condition, as the wind chill is really cold in the higher camps. 
Yes, green trails is a great initiative. However, it'll be good to think about initiatives to raise awareness amongst other trekkers in some way who are leaving their stuff behind.
Nandana was an amazing experience coordinator!! She has been working alongside all through the journey before and after the trek, providing timely and all necessary information. She was always there when I needed it and she also reached out proactively when needed. 
Dushyant is the best trek leader I've seen with IH. He's full of energy and has a great way to connect personally to everyone in the team. He constantly checked with everyone in the team about their well-being, encouraged the team to do the right thing for the team, the trek, and the mountains. His storytelling sessions during the evening tea/snacks sessions will stay with me forever. He knows a lot about the trails/mountains/mythologies/running and everything in between. He's a great asset to IH. keep up the great work!! Looking forward to another trek to meet you somewhere in the mountains.

This is my first trek with India hikes and I'm really happy that we are going to be connected for a long long time. 
On the first day, after a long jeep journey, the 2km trek seemed depressing and I was left with self doubt but all of that changed when all the seniors addressed us and briefed the team. On the 8th day after the trek was completed and reality struck ,it felt like I bid goodbye to family. There was no trek leader or trek guide or trekker, we were a family and looked out for each other and bonded very well during the trek. Rupin pass in the autumn is very dear to me now and a part of me will remain there forever. I would love to do the challenging trek in the summer as well and relive these memories someday. 
Every bit of the trek and the facilities were on point. Starting from the punctual and disciplined trek leader to the supportive trek guides.
 I'm most grateful to the camp staff who took care of all our necessities. No complaints. 
Green Trails
It's an amazing initiative and I will cultivate this habit moving ahead, once our trek was over there was a moment where I would still look for the ecobag. Green trails was an integral part of my journey and I'm happy I played a small role in keeping the ranges clean. 
Lay being one of the youngest among the entire group guided the team very systematically from the time we landed at Jiskun till we departed from Sangla. He brought a very philosophical and deeply emotional touch to our group sessions and gave us a chance to look into my mind and heart. He handled every problematic situation in a very mature manner and diligently.

If I describe the experience I have with this trek with Indiahikes in single word - ""Uncustomary"" .
Right from the registration phase to the conclusion phase, it was extraordinary.
Indiahikes - team really exhibits their vision and value in each of the stages. Either it is ""green trails' ' or ""not disturbing nature while tracing"". You can easily figure out that their team lead very much abiding by their vision and high values. 
Green Trails is one of the very extraordinary initiatives. After knowing and leaving with that thought for almost 7 days on track, that changed all perspectives about the use of non-degradable items like polythene.

I just concluded my Dayara Bugyal trek with India hikes and the experience was truly amazing. Everything was well managed right from the beginning of the trek to the end of it. The entire India hikes team including trek leader, guides and support staff effectively managed the entire trek and they were always available for us throughout the trek. They knew their responsibilities very well and they made the entire trek truly amazing for all of the participants. Everything was well planned and managed.

It was an incredible experience with India hikes. This was my first ever trek. I had an amazing life changing experience. for first 2 days I was cursing myself for choosing trek instead of some leisure trip. But as we reached close to the summit I could see that this perception of mine is changing and I was feeling lucky to be there, all the views, green trails, mountains, glimpses of peaks, rainbows, all of it was WOW!
At the summit, I could feel the change in myself and was literally in tears. I had decided I would do treks in future for sure.

I have done a couple of treks with Indiahikes before and every experience is better than my previous experience. The trek was indeed a treat to my mind and soul but the credit for making it a success solely goes to Indiahikes. The trek was well organised, meticulously planned and conducted by an excellent, devoted and well trained group. I fell ill on the third day of trek but our trek leader, khush made sure to that I get well soon and complete the trek. Khush was well informed, well trained and loves his work. He was always engaged with each one of us and always there for help. Kudos to Indiahikes for making trekking possible for all of us!

It was my first ever trekking experience. I believe I chose the best community for it. As first experience is something that decides the course of ahead journey. India hikes gives an wonderful base experience  for trekking. Now, what makes it wonderful can be dissected into parts. 
The very first thing I like about your community is your sensitivity towards conserving the wilderness of Himalayas. Every day I was collecting the waste and understanding the how nature works on my summit to Gidara Bugyal. As nature-lover, It gives means pleasure to see how pragmatic approach you are taking to preserve the Himalayas.
Next add on was the trek leader and his team, Everyone knew their roles and responsibilities thoroughly. they were very well aware about the protocols. Kush with his excelllent leadership and communication skills made my experience more impactfull. With his anecdotes and mythological stories From Mahabharata epic, It was an enriching experience for me.
Last but not least, I met some crazy and lively souls who I'm sure will in touch for lifetime. I got some new companions to enjoy my life.
Overall, It was a Fantastic experience. I love the people, mountains, rivers and trees more than ever before. Thank you for helping me reconnecting with nature so deeply.

The group therapies and fun activities brought us closer to each other in the mountains, it made me more humane and got to know people without expectations which was the best feeling i have ever experienced in my life, there was no judgment whatsoever everybody was so helpful and the motto was to help each other on difficult trails and terrains and push each other out of their comfort zone to reach the summit which i am taking back to my civilisation life that no matter what i will try to be a helpful person whenever i can.

The experience was overall very good. All the arrangements, whether stay, food was good. What I especially liked was that the entire group was always kept busy / involved. Even after the day's walking was done, the TL would spend time with us and play games/share stories. 
This especially helped as out trek was almost cancelled because of incessant rains for 48 hours. Keeping the morale high is a crucial factor which is easy to overlook. 
I also loved the focus on Nature. There were activities done that helped us connect with nature more and appreciate it. I feel this is the crux. If people can carry over the love for nature and make it part of their lives, the world would be a much better place!
Both the local guides (Amit jee and Ayush) were super helpful and an amazing company as well. Especially on the descent on the pass crossing day, I feel a lot of people would have struggled to walk through the boulder section without their help.

It was my second time going with IndiaHikes for a Himilayan Trek. There is no doubt why I chose IndiaHikes again.
They have a different way of looking at the mountains which by the first experience I knew is aligned with the natural habitat, and what I was looking for in a trek organization.
The team and the people in the front lines are the representatives of the core value India Hikes tries to inspire in each trekker's life.
The learnings and the connections made are forever, they not only make you feel safe but also teach you and prepare you for future DIY treks, making you aware of all that goes into being trek ready with the safety-first approach.
Green Trails initiate is the highlight on which IndiaHikes firmly stands,  which I believe is a necessity for all generations to follow.
Values of sustainable living and being happy with using less has been instilled so much that I am 24x7 on alert mode to figure out ways I can use less and live more.

I have been trekking since 2012, with Sar Pass being my first trek. What started as a trend-hopping journey, soon developed into a passion after completing Sar Pass.
The trek taught me the importance of mental fortitude, resilience, resourcefulness and introspection. Equipped with these new tools, I returned to the city life and began my journey of transformation. Since then, I have grown not only in my professional life, but personal life too.
Indiahikes has played an important role in this journey, as it became the platform for any and all the inspiration to continue trekking. Recently I completed Gaumukh Tapovan with Indiahikes, and I can testify to the fact that there description about the trek is a perfect teaser.
Thank you IH for giving us a way of life that's more personal than anything else. And to many more such treks.
Resourcefulness & Green Trails, the biggest trait for trekking successfully and sustainably.
Nandana, experience coordinator for GT, has been very helpful. She played an instrumental role in preparing us for the trek and told us about all necessary steps. Couldn't have been possible without her.

My trek with Indiahikes was truly a fantastic one . I enjoyed every moment on the mountains with the team . 
It was truly a very difficult trekking trail . Without fitness I don’t think so it would be possible and the way the team was behind everyone for it’s fitness made it easy and joyful for us to do the summit and get smiles on our faces.
Our coordinator was really keen about knowing the fitness schedule that we are going and kept on asking for the updates regularly. That’s the only way to do it smooth on the mountains. 
I think I don’t have much to say about the trek leader as she was exceptional the way she managed everything in a smooth and easy manner . The best technical guide and the team leader that I have come across . It was highly impossible to cross the tricky patches without the help of the trek leader .Wish to trek with the same team leader and technical guides in my future treks with indiahikes.

This is my first trekking experience with IndiaHikes and I must say Indiahikes is one of the very responsible and sustainable organization at so many levels from the brief that we had at the start of the trek to the daily warm-ups and cool down. Everything was completely coordinated and our trek leader and guide made 100% effort to make it worth it for all of us.
The routine has taught a lot of things to us and the way our team has picked up lot of plastic waste in the valley is commendable Now I realized this on my way and can see waste at a lot of places it is just an eye-opener. 
Tarsar Marsar is so peaceful as a site and one can empty all his cravings and desires at Tarsar lake the first time I saw it and the size of it made me so peaceful from inside and I never wanted to leave that lake although I wished if campsite would actually have been put near the lake which was quite far in our case.
I am so grateful to Indiahikes at this front earlier when I started trekking I used to think my next generation might not be able to see such places without getting corrupted now I feel bit assured that lot of things are changing in fact we can make our trails much better then we found them I am so thankful to IndiaHikes.

First of all, I would like to extend my gratitude to India Hikes for the phenomenal experience it offered us. Their pre trek training schedule is structured and pushes us to work towards our fitness goals. The exhaustive lists to pack the right things and not overpack is very helpful. The conversations among the group begins way before the trek and this helps settle anxieties over group dynamics etc. The trek leader was god, humble and fun- that enabled setting up of firm boundaries for the trek- times, looking out for each other and ascending as a collective group. The trek itself was astounding and the we had sunny days all along which made the boulder jumping easy and the descent less scary. The excitement reaches a frenzy on Summit day and the summit experience is transformative, reflective and calming. The local trek guides are absolutely wonderful and quietly support trekkers who need their help. The food is delicious, fresh, piping hot and we so look forward to it each time. Gulab jamun, kheer, phirni, carrot halwa, at dinner time under the star lit sky is simply out-of-this-world. Equipment was good and did not pose hassles. Renting equipment makes so much sense- shoes I would recommend everyone to get their own comfortable pair. Shoe bites are not pleasant. The only thing I was not comfortable with was the dish washing system- yes, it may save water, but ieven if one person does not follow the steps, the systems falls apart and everyone stands a risk of infection. The loo tents were clean and not a problem at all. The Tarsar Marsar was a great experience and a mother to a nine year old, I recommend this to other families with young children. Thanks, India Hikes. We hope to trek with you next year. By inspiring more families to embrace trekking, and be close to nature, you got this!

First of all I would like to thank India hikes for such a unique experience. Hampta pass trek was one of the best decisions of life till date. With India hikes your safety is assured. They monitor your well being regularly. Hampta pass is a cross over trek where the surroundings suddenly change from greenery of Parvati valley to dry Spiti valley after the cross over. The trails, the campsites were all beautiful and we'll organised. Even at that high altitude they provided us hot and tasty food which is really appreciable. The entire staff is so polite and friendly ... They even made cake for 2 guys whose Birthday was during our trek. Hats off to them. Its not easy to conduct such treks but India hikes conducts it in a professional way and make it look so simple. From crossing the river, sliding the snow, passing through a waterfall and gazing the night sky full of stars... it's a trek I will cherish forever. Even if some ups and downs occur during the trek they're highly motivating. I would like to re do this trek if possible in some other season.
 Green trails should become a way of life. After my trek I made some changes in my daily life. Now even if I go to get a food parcel I carry my own tiffin box and do not waste covers and papers for that. Thank you India hikes for teaching us this valuable lesson.
I learnt the basic information of trek gear required for the trek according to the season. The campsites, the toilet tents etc were also noteworthy.
Nandana was my experience coordinator. She used send a mail daily for preparation for the trek. Initially I used to feel why these mails... But later I started to realise the importance of these mails and started to read each mail in detail and it actually helped us to prepare for the trek. Fitness, backpack etc was only because of her advice.
Swarada Gangurde our trek leader... She was simply amazing. Didn't expect such a young girl to lead the team from the front. She used to check saturation regularly and also ask for our well being, sleep etc. She was polite and friendly. It was great to have her as our trek leader.

I totally loved trekking Pin Bhaba Pass, mesmerizing views, change in landscape, flowers, meadows, The oversall experience with the IndiaHikes was great right from the booking itself. I like the professionalism shown by IndiaHikes. I liked the concept of green trails and dry toilets. The whole management and trek team appeared dedicated and excited at work. The trek planning for Pin Bhaba was brilliant such as fitness requirement of trekkers, good food, nice campsites, well planned daily mileage to be covered as per the difficulty & altitude, acclimatization day, etc. All trek guides were super fit, knowledgeable and concerned about safety of all the trekkers. The best thing I liked about the Pin Bhaba was that it was not crowded and it was very clean trek. Our eco bags were not full any of the days.
Green Trails is the reason I feel attached with the IndiaHikes. I want to imbibe minimalistic consumption approach. That way we put less pressure on the environment.

It was brilliant. Truly appreciate the commitment to sustainability and the efforts taken to minimize the impact on the environment. Loved the little things like hugging trees and drinking from the streams.
And a huge shout-out for the brilliance of the trek leaders.
Nandana was great, with continuous updates and motivation to get fit ever since I signed up for the trek. The google meet before the trek was particularly helpful. 
Learning to pitch tents and also how to descend steep slopes safely. Descending has always been a mental block for me but Trek Leader Sucheta's continuous support, tips and guidance while descending from Hampta Pass was of huge help to me.
I cannot thank our Trek Leader Sucheta enough. Being my first high altitude trek, I had a lot of doubts and fears but Sucheta put me at ease right from the first day - I could sense her very high competence and knew our whole group was in safe hands. 
But additionally, I loved her passion for the mountains and the amount of knowledge she had about everything from the peaks to the flowers. She got excited with the rest of us for every glimpse of high snowy peaks and continuously pointed out things of interest. Brilliant freewheeling conversations about the mountains with Sucheta and later with ATL Abir (who joined us later) were one of the highlights for me personally! 
As I mentioned earlier, I owe Sucheta a lot for her help and constant support on sections I found difficult. 
Finishing the trek was only possible thanks to Sucheta and Abir. Special thanks also to Chaubey ji, Roshan ji and Deepinder ji who were all of huge support at different sections on the trail.

I would specially like to highlight the general safety I felt throughout the trek especially knowing that the trek leader (Karan) and the local guides (Anu and Tara) always had everything under control and at no point was there anything to worry about, the BP checks, the oxymeter checks to just simply asking us how we feel added to the feeling of safety and their knowledge of the surroundings and weather and so on. The campsites always seemed to be perfectly located in terms of the general scenic views (which just seemed to get better from one camp to the next), distance from the previous camp, the water sources located nearby etc. Certain activities like ""pause for the view"" or the mini tasks such as observing things added to the overall experience.
The information provided by Nandana via emails and the video call was extremely valuable and honestly just following those suggestions/advice is all one needs to prep for the trek.
Karan was superb, he tolerated all our nonsense in the camp (ask him about the 6 guys from Bombay, that's all you'll need to know). He was always approachable and answered ever query I has which just gave a certain degree of reassurance.

Since the first time I was recommended IndiaHikes by a friend, I have looked no further than IH for my treks. Being an avid trekker, this organisation makes trekking not only so much more convenient, safe and enjoyable but also responsible, which is my strongest personal inclination towards IH. 
The GPS navigation is a tremendously helpful tool. I feel more confident about navigating the trails.
My trek leader (Amrut) has been an extremely meticuluos trek leader. Very affectionate, tendering to everyone despite it being an extraordinarily huge group. The experiences that he provides to everyone, being fun are also highly introspective and intimate, helping us connect more as a team. As a professional too, I'd like to believe, I felt I was in safe hands.

Trekking with India hikes team were one of the best days of my life. I met such great people and made amazing friends. The safety culture at India hikes is commendable  and we always felt being in safe hands.
I would definitely come back for another trek with India hikes and recommend to my friends as well.
Green trails is a very nice initiative and would inspire people to take care of environment not only at mountains but in day to day life as well

 Till date I've did all my 3 treks with Indiahikes and I can say till now this is my best experience out of all. Right from briefing on the first day till the end of trek everything was properly organised and we had our time enjoying and bonding with the fellow trekkers. IH is known for its safety for the fellow trekkers and I literally saw how each and every person right from TL to Guides took personal care of all of us until end of the trek. Everything was perfect and the knowledge and experience which I gained from this trek is something beyond the other few treks which I did.
I'm one who doesnt like to litter at random places. However after I started trekking with IH, I started looking at these things differently. I'm still trying to differentiate the wastes and segregate them accordingly and also trying to reduce the waste from my end as much as possible like exactly how I do while trekking.
Prathima was my trek coordinator. She was clear, subtle and very much helpful in resolving all my questions and queries. Her extensive knowledge and constant following up even after we boarded the tempo for our base camp showed her love for the job and the care she took for the trekkers.
 
Akshay Upreti.. This might be a bit dramatic however I literally loved this guy on how he managed everything. This guy is literally a mini-wikipedia based on the knowledge he possessed and is the go-to man for everything. Right from the first day he mentioned where he'll be staying so that if we have any trouble or concerns he asked us to reach out to him even at midnight. The way he led the group, the way he conversed with everyone, the way he motivated and to mention it again the knowledge he has, like our fellow trekkers mentioned, I'd also like to add that if I ever lead a team anywhere, I'd take Akshay as my inspiration. He let us cook for the entire team on the acclimatization day which I'm still thankful for as I'm fond of cooking and feel food brings people even more together. Also, the personal care he took on each and every one of us really touched me. Thanks again to Akshay for making my trek even better and thank you very much for your valuable teachings on AMS, HAPE & HACE, this was really helpful.
Thank You Akshay Bro for everything and also wanted to thank Pavan, Vipin and Santhosh Bhaiya for their motivation & help throughout the trek without even a pinch of hesitation.
I know IH has been extensively trying to make trekkers trek on our own and even saw the initiative of sharing the GPX files on request for some of the DIY treks for free. However I wasnt able to use this till now, but looking forward to use it in the near future and will definitely share you guys how my experience was.

I admire IndiaHikes' motto ""everyone must trek"". I appreciate the detailed documentation on the IH website, the professionalism in communication with trekkers before the start of the trek, environmental consciousness as a guiding undercurrent, as well as the background and on-the-field processes and operations of IH. In sum, I would say that IH has reflected well to make trekking into an ""experience"" rather than an activity. For many people a trek with IH becomes a life changing event. 
I truly appreciate the Green Trails philosophy at IH. This is a differentiator of IH. As trekkers, it makes us conscious of our footprint on the environment and think about sustainability as a guiding undercurrent. I learnt to use the GAIA app. It is a great companion esp for DIY treks. We also played a game that emphasized this. 
I appreciate the regularity and the professionalism in the communications from Prathima. We had a google meet session a few days before the trek that helped us clear our doubts. 
Krupa Vyas demonstrated excellent leadership with a great blend of task and people orientation. If her communication was A+, her attitude was A++. When a co-trekker struggled with persistent low O2 saturation at the Tarsar camp-site, she administered oxygen to that person the whole night sacrificing her sleep and continued to trek with the group the next morning without a murmur. She has ""top management"" written all over her.

My trek experience last week with India Hikes to Tarsar Marsar lakes, Kashmir - July 22nd -29th was incredible. Everything fit so perfectly. First of all the trek leader was amazing. Ms Krupa Vyas was a thorough professional in guiding us step by step and taking us through even the smallest details of how to fold, pack, and the do's and don'ts of the trek ...she was super clear in her instructions. The other people in the team were super caring as well. In the way the instructions are imparted, trekkers are guided and taken care of, i could see the reflection of the value system of IH and their noble vision in transforming hearts and lives ! This trek in particular made me feel so connected with everything - the nature & surroundings, people, our helpers, camp site managers & trek mates. We became like a one whole family in the mountains !! I deeply thank IH for this experience. I wish to do the same trek again with my other friends next year. 
Since this was my first trek with tents, i learnt how to pitch and unpitch a tent, which was super exciting !! :)  This skill gave me the confidence of doing a trek on my own.

The Indiahikes experience was exceptional. As a millennial living in Mumbai, it's easy to get caught up in the small lows and highs of life as a professional. This trek was a big and meaningful reminder of- the beauty of nature and the very real threats we are posing to nature through our current lifestyle, the small things we take for granted living at home (running water, electricity), the trust and teamwork you can build with your indiahikes group to encourage, support and help each other, pushing your boundaries. The Tarsar Marsar hike experience was this and more- Kashmir's beauty will always hold a special place in my heart. Amidst this stunning landscape- the Indiahikes team took the care to ensure we were safe, but also explain to us the little things- how to get into your sleeping bag, how to prevent blisters, hydration, green trails- making us feel an integral part of this incredible value driven organization.
 It's such an empowering feeling to be a part of greentrails and feel like we're doing our part to keep the mountains green. But also, there is strength in numbers and the fact that this initiative overall can drive a meaningful difference is so inspiring.

My experience was amazing. The way the trek was organised, the way we were given information at every stage of the trek was truly exceptional. The weather got bad during the second half of the trek but there was not a moment where we felt we werent safe. The trek leader Krupa added to this amazing Tarsar Marsar trek experience.
On this trek I learnt how to put up and take off and fold my own tent since in Kashmir there are no fixed camps and this was a great experience as you dont get this experience outside Kashmir treks.
Since my first trek with Indiahikes I have always tried to live a sustainable life … I have reduced use of plastic bags to almost 0 and make sure I join my area community on beach cleanups occasionally as beaches in Mumbai often get littered after weekends
Prathima has been my experience coordinator for the second time and I think she is the best EC there could ever be . She made sure we had all the information required before our trek. She cared for everyone like her own family and made sure everyone reached the basecamp fully prepared for the next 6 days.
Krupa Vyas was an outstanding trek leader . The way she led the team from Day 1 was truly inspiring. The weather was bad but she always kept our hopes high and made sure we had a great time throughout the trek.

It was just simply awesome. Can't ask for more. Everything is very professional and all details are shared in the minutest of ways and also in a brief way wherever needed. We had an amazing trek leader in Krupa. Everything was awesome. Due to heavy rains we missed Sundersar (though we camped near it) and Marsar lakes but cant help it. We did experience the unique nature of trek when it rains heavily. Food was good, everything was punctual.  
Ranger rolls, unpitching tents.. almost learnt how to pitch a tent.. sustainable/compact packing..surgeons's knot (not sure of the name) for the shoes... walking with trek poles.. sustainable washing practices.
Prathima was good.. quick with her responses and provided all the clarifications i needed :) Her fitness inspired me to get fitter as well to have competitive run pace :P :)
Krupa is just amazing. Was soo happy and proud to have a female trek leader. Women are doing wonders everywhere but it is even more special when it comes to such a physically and emotionally challenging thing such as being a trek leader. We experienced heavy rainfalls (there was high alert in Kashmir) but she made the best calls considering all the factors. She made sure everything was provided to the trekkers and in a timely manner. Though there was a heavy rainfall, she made us feel safe throughout and made sure we could experience the maximum in such conditions. Looking forward to trekking with her again.

Indiahikes are Truely Stalwarts. They have maintained their Legacy when it comes to Safety of Trekkers. It is just amazing to be part of such Organisation.
 Safety First.. Trekking is Not just Reaching Summit but it is to Avoid any Kind of Emergencies & Staying Together as A Team.. Proper Exercise to Stay Fit during Trek.. Use of Trekking Gears which will avoid injury and can Facilitate Sustainable Trekking.. Last But not Least GREEN TRAILS.. Leave mountains Clean as they are.
Our Trek Coordinator was Nandana. She not only helped in Preparing for Trek and Motivating us But she was really helpful right from Booking Stage and She was easily appproachable to guide us at every stage. Thank you Nanadanaji.
They are actually Ambassadors of Indiahikes who represent IH and it’s value all the time. Our Trek Leader Ankur Malani was Gem of Person among them..

Trekking was India hikes was everything that was promised to me on the trek. I love how super organized the team is before the trek - knowing what to get, what our schedule will be, regular follow ups etc. And the experience on the trek was phenomenal. We had an enthusiastic trek leader (who helped us stay motivated during the trek) we didn't have to worry about our safety cause it was given utmost priority at any stage. I love how we left the mountains cleaner and not dirtier while coming back. HEADS UP FOR SUSTAINABILITY. 
Nandana was our trek coordinator. She was just amazing. We got preparation mails, setup meets before the treks for queries and she was available through whatsapp too.
Sachi was our trek leader from India hikes. She is one of the most joyous, open minded and friendly person that I've met! We loved having her on our team. Apart from being an amazing trek guide she also came up with smaller activities for us like ""Hug a tree"" or ""Drink water from the river like an animal"" 
These smaller activities helped us connect with nature and ourselves.
Also love you Sachi! thank you for making me your assistant trek leader (though I didn't do anything at all, but it made me believe you could really do well in things if you put your heart to it - and this trek was everything I was looking forward to in my vacations!)

It was exactly what was promised on the website. I was thoroughly impressed with the staff and the trek leader who was always aware of what he was doing and insightful about the terrain and the challenges faced by the body at high altitude. I was sold on the philosophy behind the Green Trails initiative and it is something I resonate with strongly. It was very heartening to receive an eco bag to thrash the litter found on the trail and I am glad I chose Indiahikes for my trek. Every aspect of the trek stood out in terms of the quality being provided and the expertise of the personnel involved. 
I tried my best to collect as much trash as possible and I have the badge of a Green Getter to show for my efforts but unfortunately, there was a lot of trash along the trail of Hampta Pass which reflects the popularity of the trail. I did not do enough to rid the trail of everything. it was too much to fit in an eco bag. I am extremely glad that I did something to erase some of the trash from the grandeur of the mountains I encountered on the trail. I am not confident but I am resolute in my conviction of doing even more on my next trek with Indiahikes. 
Nandana was very kind and considerate. She always met us with a smile and carried a lot of clarity in her directions. She was very thorough in her communications, her emails were of a lot of help and they took care of every doubt which in turn ensured that I did not have to bother Nandana at all. Every question was answered and every doubt was anticipated beforehand.  
I have been very conscious of my carbon footprint and my consumption habits ever since I learned about climate change and the impact of humans on the planet at large. So I try to be conscientious in my consumption as much as possible. My adoption of a sustainable lifestyle started long back and Green Trails only helped in reinforcing my resolve to be as sustainable and minimalistic as possible.

The whole experience was top tier, no doubt. It was my first time with indiahikes and it was beyond my expectations.
What stood out for me was the amount of effort that was put from the whole team , be it the trek leaders the cook team, never seen this type of people who are so humble and considerate to each and every person in the group.11/10 for all the efforts been put for our safety and well-being.
The green trails is an amazing initiative. The mountains deserve so much more. We did leave the mountains better but not fully clear. There was so much more garbage and it was just sad to see. 
Our coordinator was amazing, she always followed up on everything , in fact, one of the member had been injured and she followed up even after the trek was over about her well-being. This just furthers the fact that yall actually care about the safety of your trek team.
Our trek mentor Ayushi told us so many things about everything. She always got into details even with the smallest of things. We obviously know a lot more than before we started the trek. 
I learnt a lot about segregation of waste which is THE most crucial step. I have also started trying to segregate waste at home.

Although the feeling of just being amongst high mountains in that fresh air and silence holds very dear and it is almost impossible to put it in words, but if I have to, it will be the resilience of standing tall and high in any conditions, being humble and allowing hard working deserving climbers to see their magic from up close and being merciless with harsh weather and terrain.
You never conquer the mountains, they allow you to see them from a little closer, only if you are prepared and ready to persevere even when things go haywire sometimes.
Goechala was very esp. The decision was made in Feb this year when I felt it was time. My awesome Gaumukh trek experience was majorly responsible leading me to get some more and learn some more from the mountains, the IH team and locals and I was more than overwhelmed.
From trekking through thick dense forests, crossing multiple suspension bridges with colorful prayer flags to hiking up wooden logs to a snow storm while climbing towards Dzongri to the contagious silence at Dzongri top to crystal clear views of Kanchenjunga from view point 1, this trek had it all - the freshness, the flavour, the toil, the race against the sun, two summit climbs and finally a great support team of Dhaval, Killan bhai and Manoj bhai.
We all were literally pampered by Mahi bhai and Khadak bhai with momos, chowmein, thukpa, manchow soups, and what not.
Kudos to Dhaval who ensured everyone goes to the summit, feels the moment, be thankful for it and come back safely. Small cues like covering our heads, sipping water, sipping ORS were the keys that entire batch could successfully complete the trek.
Loved the new tents from Hillman, finally no locked-up tent doors :P
The liner was very comfortable. Although I have to learn how to use the sleeping bag. It gets very cold and wet at midnight.
 As I mentioned, Dhaval and the local guides and kitchen staff ensured all of us complete the trek smiling and carefree.
Hats off to the entire IH team. Leading in the unpredictable mountains on a difficult trek is one hell of a feat!
We played ""Contact"", I loved it. We also enjoyed learning about marking the trail to search for the water bottle :))
Snowman making at Dzongri.
""Gratitude circle"" on the summit. Everybody got a chance to pour their hearts out.
Finally, the debriefing, the best! Afterthoughts and reflection.
Fitness is an absolute must, no doubts. I had pushed myself better than what i did last time and I was glad that my oxygen levels and pulse were normal even on hard days .
Green trails initiative is something that adds on to my conscience every single time. I think it is a pretty good way to transform humans in general, not just in the mountains. We should all be aware not to spread negativity so that it doesn't rebound and hit us back!
I also loved the transformation initiatives in the toilet tents - the wooden planks, the sawdust and flower bag for fragrance made my ""big business"" time very pleasant :))

It was an awesome experience. I was little worried initially as this was my first trek experience but, IndiaHikes made this a memorable one. I must say I enjoyed every moment of my trek and want to say 'Everyone must Trek'. :-)
I really liked the support I received from IH team from the time I booked the trek, Firstly, Pratima's series of mails with enough details made me confident. what to take, what to rent, what fitness required, details on Altitude sickness etc. This was really helpful .
Secondly, IH team on the ground at Raithal, was really helpful and knowledgably. so, my special thanks for Ravi, Tharun, Prabesh, Loki (a.k.a Lokendar Rawat) and his cooking team. Without these people's support, my trek wouldn't have been a memorable experience.
Finally, the 4 pillars of IH is what makes it unique, the knowledge of different things, like how to use maps, how to navigate, using Radio's. making it the safest treks. and Green trials experience was too good. Because of all these, we were able to experience clean mountains and best trek experience. Kudos to IH for making this an awesome experience.

The trek itself was not very challenging, so for me it was more about being within nature than the trek itself. Indiahikes facilitated that link between self and nature incredibly, through activities like Hug a Tree. I also really enjoyed other activities, like the Navigation activity, which not only informed us of new technology but also instigated collaboration, teamwork and rarities such as analogue map-making skills. Such activities made my experience with Indiahikes stand out in comparison to my past treks. The trek leader was extremely helpful with providing information, about the trek and about our surroundings. I learnt a lot about the Himalayas and this information was more valuable because I gained it through experiential anecdotes instead of objective information through google searches. Normally I'm a quiet person because I find it difficult to engage in conversations that seem un-interactive and un-insightful. However, throughout the trek, I found myself consciously seeking dialogues with the Indiahikes staff and my team members because every single interaction taught me something new. 
We also had many general briefing sessions about the Himalayan topography and the formation of mountains. Ravi Sir was very detailed in his explanations and I'm confident that I know much more about the Himalayas and our trek than when I first began. 
 I plan to practice minimalism at home, as far as possible.

- Water conservation. I liked the 3 bucket system and the mug with a hole idea. Its great to see such simple and effective innovations
- Green trails. This is a great initiative and hope you keep going.
 

I loved the water conservation efforts that you have taken up. This is something that i will try to build into my daily life going forward.

Mountains are beautiful and the journey better still. And Indiahikes made it an exceptional one for for me. I loved everything about the trek. From the time I signed up for the trek to communication till now, I love the engagement. It is not just about one trek but so much more in terms of knowledge about the trekking as an activity, the topography of the region, the people in the team- everything was fantastic.
It was easy to reach the basecamp with all the information provided. We were welcomed very warmly by trek leader Ravi and others in the team. The journey was beautiful. I made a vlog about it! The guides were so warm and the food served was terrific. It was way more than our expectations in the mountains. The people did everything with a pleasant disposition. In that chill, they were not grumpy when we asked for hot water! Pulse was checked thrice in a day. Ravi carried the heavy equipment right till the summit. Also impressed with your green trails initiative. I feel more and more children and youngsters should go on a trek with IH so that these values can be imparted at the right age. It has been almost a week since the trek but I am still there , walking in the mountains and the woods... Thank you for a lifetime experience. 
Especial thanx to our trek leader Ravi- he gives 100 percent to his work. It is inspiring.
There was not much litter/waste in our trek route. I understood the importance of your work only when we stopped at a road side cafe for breakfast on the way back. It was just some 30 kms away from the base camp but the scene was totally different. On the backside of the cafe, I found a mountain of plastic! Reality struck then. This was an eye opener. I am happy that we were sensitised enough to carry back our own waste. Green trails are a success. 
Absolutely! I feel I can write an exam paper on the same and pass with flying colours. Currently I am happily sharing all my information with whoever wants to know more about the trek. 
Ravi piqued our interest towards so much more. I have been watching some informational videos with my children. 
But I have also understood that there is so much more that I need to learn. 
Prathima was fully engaged from the time we signed up for the trek. And she has been answering all of our queries with a lot of patience. What I liked best was that she seemed as excited as us- the first time trekkers about our journey. Thank you.
Sustainability is such a big term.
Taking care of the environment in terms of not littering, keeping one's surroundings clean and even creating one's compost is possible but it is so much to do with materialism and consumerism and also man's greed. There is no end to our desires.
I am still dabbling with the idea on a conceptual level.

I had an amazing experience with Indiahikes! The values exuded by our trek leader Mr. Aditya Bodke as well as the rest of the crew accompanying him felt close to heart and very relatable. Its commendable how everyone at Indiahikes made me feel like I’ve been trekking for years, even though this was my first trek ever!
An honourable mention for the cooking team who cooked such scrumptious meal at such height with limited resources!
Green Trails was something I read about on IH website before coming to the trek and I had the impression that it was a theoretically sound initiative, but seeing this hands-on during the trek and the willingness and passion of the IH team to actually follow it in their lives is appreciable. I cannot speak on behalf of other trekkers, but I can certainly state that I’ve been making conscious choices even when I’m back home - specially about not generating micro-plastic. “Reduce, rather than reuse and/or recycle” - as told to us by Mr. Aditya Bodke. So yes, I feel confident that we certainly left the mountains better than we found them.
 I have been making conscious choices as to reduce the generation of waste in the first place. Its like it has become a second instinct. It has certainly impacted my life in a positive way and I would try to spread this message among the people I know. Green Trails is probably going to be a decisive factor in choosing Indiahikes for my next trek.
Nandana has been in touch with us since the day we booked our trek. She has been extremely helpful in explaining even trivial and stupid queries which we had without losing her cool. She helped with the smooth coordination of the arrangement of another tempo traveller when the one we already had met with an accident.
Gaurav has been like a jolly friend to us when we were at the basecamp. Carrying the welcoming smile that he has, he explained the processes, the IH community that we are now a part of and how we can easily reach IH in case we ever need any information about any trek / travel related information. He played an influential role with the payment deadlock that we had with cab service providers.

My first high altitude trekking experience has sparked an undying longing for the views at the mountains and I will surely keep returning to trek with Indiahikes in the future.
Ours was the last batch for the Brahmatal Trek. 
The mountains were already a better place and almost untainted owing to the efforts of all the previous batches. Proof that Green Trails has been very effective :D 
I learnt everything from scratch throughout the trek. How to tie the trekking shoes, how to wear the trekking bag, how to use the trekking poles. We even unpitched the tents. All this knowledge supplementing the numerous tidbits we were already learning about the places, campsites, mountains etc.,
Treating us as trekkers and not tourists instilled a lot of responsibility within us. Though I have tried taking up challenges to produce lesser waste with each passing day, Green Trails was the icing on the cake. Taught me to travel, trek and live responsibly amidst the extremities as well.
The coordinators answered my innumerable last minute queries with utmost patience. Very responsive! 
The live session conducted 2 weeks prior to the trek helped a lot as well.

Just out of box. Never expected this.. All the four trails was more of great knowledgeable experience.
Green trails left the entire grp little responsible as a humane to the nature. Indeed it is a great thought... Which I'm grateful for IH for Knowledging us and I'm promising to follow the green trails in my city and educate more abt this here too. 
The entire experience was really informative. Just impressed by the thought and the greatful for minds behind this. 
Leo, ankur, chachaji and nari.... Wow what a team of captaincy they did.... They are not just leaders... One of our family now... It's that great that they took care of us... Loads of respect, gratitude and love to them... Thanks a ton!!!

This was my 2nd IH experience.
It was educational, benefitial, reflective, fun, interesting, friendly, disciplined ..
Considering the fact that it was in the remote hills, yet IH provided such splendid facilities, I'll add luxurious.
Leo was awesome, awesome being an understatement. He not only was informative regarding the trees, environment, birds, mountains, trails, Gaia, local language, rock climbing
But also, assured that in the campsite time, there were always some FUN activities planned. Loved the socialising and inner happiness brought by those activities.
By Leo, I mean Leo, Ankur and team
The 4 value pillars
Green Trails
Me and my friends, went on a trip after the trek.
Not kidding, the green trails instilled such awareness in us
We consciously cut our consumption of plastic
Bought milky bar over dairy milk (as it's wrapped in cardboard+foil)
Avoided bottled water, carried our own
Butchered our craving for Maggi, completely.
Pringles over lays, angoor bhaiya dabbay may daal do, thaili may Nahi
Etc etc
Trekopedia: Was aware that IH provides information regarding numerous DIY treks, never had I actively used it. Taking into account this love for trekking, will surely put to use this information.

1) Majorly, All the amazing activities that were conducted on trek. Redemption of one's connection with nature. 
2) Safety and health conditions were checked before the start and end of the day. No member was left behind at any times. 
3) The idea of green trails and taking back the waste along. Makes one realise how much of a damage we're being to the planet. Big thumbs up on that 
4) Delicious Delicious food, especially the desserts. 
5) Amazing trek leaders. They were the peak reason for making this trek one beautiful unforgettable experience. 
This was third trek, first with IH. Not once on my previous i had this aching feeling of missing out on something major by the end of trek. But this it felt like leaving my heart behind. I'm definitely coming back and who knows maybe our batch gets the same leaders. 
My never ending gratitude to each and every human working at IH. Thank you so much. You guys are absolutely amazing! 
Green definitely brought a big change in everyone's Thought process. You just can't ignore the waste. I'm sure next we visit a mountain or any nature's landmark. We'll be gathering waste even without our eco bags. 
It's a very powerful initiative. Something I did not expect to come across. 
The experience coordinators were great. Kept us updated at all times. Before our batch the whole flood thing happened and our WhatsApp group was flooded with concerned messages about the trek. But you guys handled it so well with all the videos and daily updates. Ensuring us that everything was just fine!

From technical leaders to guides, to cooks, everyone on the staff on, various campsites was keen to help us in any form. 
There wasn't a sense of being left behind if one is found to lack strength; in lieu, one finds this resilient, warm feeling of reassurance that someone will definitely be there to help you out, should you need help.
For instance, on spraining her ankle, one of my fellow trekkers was carried piggyback by a young co-guide (Kushaluv Bhai), the rest of the way downhill, a profoundly admirable experience. 
I'm glad to have met such people and been in their presence, and I will definitely recommend Indiahikes to anyone who seeks my opinion on trekking in the Himalayas.

Being my 1st Himalayan trek I was quite excited and Indiahikes was my only choice. The amazing teamwork, there Greentrail concept and the extra efforts my the team made it an exceptional experience for me. I was sick in the 1st day of the trek and had lost confidence but the help and care by Indiahikes team by preparing special meals was such a kind gesture. 
Also a special mention about our trek leader Areeb. He is a real Eco-warrior. The way he explains the concept of greentrail, waste free lifestyle, green mountains and sustainably I amazing. Helps the trek to realise the importance of it. His overall experience, coordination and support during the entire trek was just amazing. Thanks you IH for the amazing experience. 
Super happy about the initiative and respecting the mountains the right way. 
I specially love the way Areeb explained the concept of why one should avoid Maggi and how it makes the mountains messy. Because of him we turn towards the local cuisine and didn’t even crave for the mountain Maggi. Most organisations don’t take such efforts to make it comfortable for trekkers and prepare for it, especially for 1st timers who are a quite nervous about it. The preparations and all the assist by the Trek Coordinator was very helpful for being ready for the trek. Being it physical fitness or what to carry, etc. 
Yes. I love mountains and seeing them covered in trash is heartbreaking. As a naturalist and environmentalist by professional I always try to pickup waste while trekking and seeing similar  initiatives taken up by Indiahikes made me quite happy. Another reason why one should chose IH for exploring the Himalayas.
Also I’ll be incorporating the same policy in my own treks and trail company’-Jungle Maniacs’.

This was my first trek experience and I surely made the right choice by choosing IndiaHikes. The guides had a personal touch to the trek and it never felt like a business service. I would definitely choose Indiahikes again for my next Trek and hopefully a to a more challenging Trek.
I am myself personally touched by the green trails mission. I would definitely try to adopt this practise in the cities which really need more immediate attention.

Trek Leader:- Areeb Parvez:
This was his first Kedarkantha trek as a leader. He is an amazing guy with lots of positive energy. Right from first day till end of the trek he is been motivating everyone and making sure that we all are in good shape and conditions to complete the trek. He has given everyone personal attention to their problems and resolving them be is medical, physical etc.
Trek Guide:- Vimlesh Rangar:
He is very good guide, simple and nice person. With him around the group will always feel safe as he ensures that everyone follows the trail and no one is lagging behind. During the trek he leads the group and takes us safely from one camp to another. He has immense knowledge about mountains, places and he is used to share with us during the trek and also at night during dinner. 
Trek Guide:- Akshay Rawat:
If we need to see a person with patience then it is Akshay. He is very clam and motivates people to go beyond their limits. He always used to be at the last with the group and takes cares of people who are not able to match the pace of others. Motivates them and ensures that they reach the cam or summit safely. Some of our group members who were behind having issues of moving forward but due to him all have made up to the summit. 
Mangal Da:
How one can forgot about Mangal Da, the man who took us to the summit. Anyone meets him once will never forget him lifetime. Such inspiring word during briefing and it instils confidence in you which will help you to reach the summit. He keeps on motivating you during push to summit which is a steep climb in freezing cold. You require such people to help you to reach the summit and we are fortunate to have one.  
Kitchen Staff:
Kitchen Staff at every camp site including base camp were amazing. They served with simple but good food which has taken care of our nutritional requirements. They are one of the back bones at such remote places where it is difficult to get a glass of warm water. 
Campsite Management Team:
Very much impressed with overall camp including the base camp. People who are responsible for managing these have done the tremendous job to keep it clean, hygienic and in a liveable conditions. 
Three sink system:
We really liked the three sink system for washing tiffin box and cutlery using saw dust. We found it very useful without using any chemical our boxes used to get clean. We appreciate to the person who has developed this.
To sum up the overall experience was very good and we all have really enjoyed the trek and I will definitely come back to India Hike for my next trek.

The experience of trekking with IH was very nice. It was heartful to see how everyone tried to make the experience as good as possible. Special thanks to the kitchen team at the basecamp and at all campsites who were at their best preparing food despite bone chilling cold, and on top of that catering to my special food needs. Need to mention sweet dish every night!! Could I have asked for more? I don't think so. 
The trek leads and guides -  Aditya, Bhagat Chacha and Yaspal Ji were always around to help, and were great as human beings and treated us like we were one of them and that was the greatest honour.  I wish I get to spend more time with them. Such energetic and jovial team you have. 
The green trail initiative is something which deserves a lot of kudos and I hope others, if not join actively to clean the mountain, can at least learn not to fill it with litter and plastic.
The daily reading of vitals is also something which I never experienced before but I feel its the most important aspect to increase the safety of the trek.Sharu (Experience Coordinator), thank you so much for helping prepare for the trek and coordinating the smallest detail. I was surprised on the morning we left for Lohajung, seeing call from you so early in the morning to check if  I boarded the transport. Honestly, I did not expect that 5 in the morning, extending your dedication to even the smallest possible detail.

When I booked my Trek I was not aware of most of the basic things like to do and what not to do on a trek, your website is full of all sorts of informative articles which is very helpful. Right from the beginning to the end the people associated with your organization were very hard working, helpful, and most importantly very particular about our health and well-being for the entire trek. 
I personally think no one can expect anything better than the experience that we as an entire Trek Team got. 
I loved it, will definitely plan for the difficult level trek, it was the best feeling when I reached the Summit, and I want to experience it more than once, as because of this trek my focus in my field has been amplified. 
My experience coordinator was Prathima, she was really good at providing us the information and providing virtual knowledge about the trek, along with that I will also talk about Lakshmi she helped me a lot personally without her help I could have never got my trek confirmed and got my rented gears. so, I appreciate the work of your entire management working at the service desk. 
The green trails are the most fun part of the entire trek, remarkably innovative and eco-friendly. Indeed I am damn confident that this initiative with the advent of time will definitely leave the mountains better than it was before.

It was such a well organized and professional trek. The trek lead, guides and the cooking staff were brilliant and usually went above and beyond to make sure we were as comfortable as possible. I would also like to commend the planning team as it was well paced and made sure that the entire group had enough time to rest and recuperate before starting again. Overall, a brilliantly coordinated experience, right from giving us tips for preparation many weeks before to the final climb, never once did I feel out of place even though I may have been out of breath :D.
Green Trails is a brilliant initiative and I genuinely feel we left the mountains a little cleaner than when we found them. I'm sure in the long run these kind of initiatives are the only way forward. I'm gonna carry my own version of the green trails bag on most if not every trip I go on.
Prathima made sure we had all the necessary information required including the checklist of items to be brought on the trek, the physical and mental preparation required to do the trek and motivating me by keeping in touch through mails and Whatsapp.

The entire journey was so co-ordinated. Transport to and from the base camp, food, everything was taken care of, As a solo traveller, doing this for the first time, that was really appreciated. 
The trek leader Areeb, co-ordinator Share, guides Birupaji and Raju Bhai, and kitchen staff - what lovely people! Ever encouraging and helpful. I really enjoyed what they taught us about trekking, how to use equipment.Confident that I can even manage a solo trek now, although thr group experience is so fun.
In retrospect, Green Trails was the best part. Trash always mars the beauty of nature. I'm thrilled that I generated no waste myself - which is an astonishingly simple thing to do - and helped clear up the waste of others. 
I loved being told to take your waste back to your cities with you and dispose of it in the municipalities. But the experience will go beyond this trek. So easy to stuff your waste in your pocket when you are out, bring it back home and segregate it. Definitely, something I plan to do. And ultimately, cut down on packaged  goods altogether.

My experience with Indiahikes was amazing! They take care of each and every detail from the time you book the trek with them. From what all things are needed, how to pack them in your bag, your safety from pick up point to the top of the summit, each and every detail of the trek is taken care of. Their trek leaders are well trained and know everything about the local terrain and flora fauna. They are very helpful and make sure all your doubts regarding the trek are solved before even starting the trek. They also have 2 local guides as a part of the trek team who know the terrain in and out and can help you with everything you can think of! The tent sites selected are very scenic and beautiful where you can spend your day enjoying the nature around. The tents and sleeping bags are of the best quality and are cleaned and sanitised after each use. You will never find any trash around the tents or at the campsite. They provide a very delicious and well balanced diet throughout your trek. You will never feel hungry or an urge to eat any packed food if you take your meals properly! They also give a dessert at the end of dinner everyday 😋
My overall experience with Indiahikes was one I would remember all my life and will recommend them to anyone who is going for a trek! 
The courteous nature of the Indiahikes team at the trek, the entire kitchen staff, their slope manager Mr Abhishek, our trek leader, Mr Dawa, Our local guides, Rohit ji and Roopmohan ji! They are the people who made our experience even better at this trek! 
Take back from this trek would be the helpful nature of each and every person staying at the base camp and at the campsites! No one would ever say no for any help you ask out of them and that is something each and everyone of us should learn!
Thank You Indiahikes for such a wonderful experience and making me fall for trekking a little bit more!

DISCIPLINE AND PUNCTUALITY : Be it getting ready for the trek or be it the meal getting ready for serving, everything was right on time, without a delay, not even once.
SAFETY : The trek leader (Parthiban), the 2 guides (Santhosh and Sandeep), and the technical guide for the summit climb (Mangal) were much patient and courageous to help everyone make this trek a successful feat for all the trekkers.
QUALITY : Quality of the campsite, the cleanliness of it and the quality of food was on par. The menu seems to have chosen carefully based on the trek that was to be followed. (Porridge, dry fruits, fresh fruits, rice and roti, sabzi, dhaal, kheer, sweet etc etc). This is something out of box, which IndiaHikes has stolen the show of meticulous planning. Had the quality of food and sleep been compromised, the trek would have definitely gone unsuccessful. Thanks to the cook/chefs available on the campsite.
A short story: During the descent from Akhoti to Gaichawon goan, I happened to shake hands with a little kid, who silently stuffed a tiny chocolate cover from his hands to mine. I felt the impact that IH has created on the mountains. The need of keeping the mountains clean has gone through the child's mind through this small initiative of Green Trials. This is a huge step for the upcoming changes that are coming through. Highly appreciate that.
The co-ordinators were much helpful in getting us fit and fine for this trek. Right from booking, renting and maintaining a physical fitness level. The first and foremost reasons of our successful trek would be their share and we dedicate this feat to them.

Brahmatal, being my second high altitude trek with Indiahikes was another great trekking experience for me. Everything on the trek was being taken care of with utmost professionalism be it health check up, food, knowledge on the Himalayas, team bonding and so on. 
The idea of Green Trails is personally very close to me and I believe this should not be limited to Indiahikes only. This initiave should be taken by every organisation and every trekker of the country to leave the mountains better than we find them. We did our part and we surely felt confident about it.
Although I did a thorough research about the trek before even booking it but there are things that helped a lot during the trek, such as GPX file. Apart from the GPX, the trek leader and guide had incredible knowledge about the surroundings which was a great learning.
Experience Coordinator has been very helpful since the beginning and very spontaneous in reaching to any queries in the group or personal. It was a group of 19 people which makes a job difficult for any coordinator but she was always available for each one of us.
I've already stopped single use plastic at home and adviced everyone else to do so and I'm making a habit of carrying my own water bottle to avoid the purchase of plastic bottles elsewhere.

The Kedarkantha trekking was the first Himalayan trek experience for me and Indiahikes has made my experience one of its kind! I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it. What I also realised was that Indiahikes just does not want us to trek a summit, they create and curate a complete lifetime experience. It was the small things that mattered the most - as simple as an encouraging wake-up call, the 10 minutes of silence on the summit and the postcard. I was in tears at the summit at the beauty of the Himalayas. The trek leader - Syama Krishna left no stone unturned to make us comfortable and motivated us every single minute. The stories we have exchanged with him, the star-gazing experience, everything is so dear to my heart and I cannot wait to trek with Indiahikes again. Thank you, truly.The experience of taking part in Green Trails was also one of a kind. While we saw other trekking groups actually leaving behind so much trash, I felt proud that Indiahikes was helping in clean up this trash. Every single waste matters and I am proud I was able to contribute in a small way to clean our mountains.

The details of the trek were briefed to us a day before starting the trek and made us mentally prepared even more for the trek.
A demo on how to use the GMX file and track our own routes was something really fascinating and gave me the confidence I can do any other trek on my own as well if I want to.
The use of micro spikes and gaters was new to me and I enjoyed it.
The trek leaders were constantly in touch with us and fascinating us with their adventures on every step of the trek. Got to learn so many things from them on the trek.
A simple thing like washing our lunchboxes was something new and different in the beginning. But now when we rewind back to the trek, there are so many memories attached to it.
Didn't feel like I was missing anything.
All of us enjoyed a lot from the day we grouped for the taxis towards Raithal, till the airport departure.
We mixed up so well that everyone one of us wanted to do 1 more trek with the same group if its possible in IH. Don't know if this was bcoz of the restrictions due to COVID-19, but it was an amazing experience.
Regarding Green Trails, 1 example I would highlight is - I had seen and heard that washing utensils in a bucket saves lots of water, but I had never tried it on my own and believe me it was a great experience.
Every day after the trek, washing hands too reminds me of saving water as much as possible.

128,Sachin Bansal,2021-01-01,Nag Tibba,"
This was not only my first trek but also my first solo trip to the Himalayas. Following are some of the lessons I have taken back from the mountains.
1.    My body can work better than my expectations if I work on it: Even though I had been preparing for this trek by going on running every day, I didn’t expect my body to maintain the kind of pace it did. The first 500m of the ascent were definitely exhausting but after that it felt good. In fact, I was always with the leading section of the group and this was very encouraging to realise. I learnt that if I continue working on my fitness, I would be able to go on longer treks and thus have more enjoyable experiences.
2.    I can work on my worst fears by facing them head-on: I am the kind of person whose legs start shaking while looking down from the 4th storey of a building. Such is my fear of heights! So, this trek was also an exercise in facing my fear. I remember that even though the views in the valleys were beautiful, I quickly got nervous by realizing where I was and how narrow and steep was the path on which I was walking. Sometimes, I even wished for my peripheral vision to get disabled so that I cannot get the slightest idea of where I am. At a point just below the basecamp, I also slipped a bit and was completely dreaded after that. Throughout the stay in the basecamp, I was very anxious because the camps were on a slope! Down with anxiety, I could not sleep well, and I kept waking up after every 1 hour or so just to check if I am not sliding down! But I completed the ascent and did reach the summit! On reaching there, I could not hold my tears as I could not believe that I had just reached the top of a mountain. I will never be able to forget this experience as it has provided me with a strong sense of courage and an affirmation that I can win over my fears with perseverance. 
3.    Nature is supreme and a walk into it is uplifting: I was absolutely taken aback by the elements of nature that I witnessed on this trek. The breath-taking view of the sunset from the basecamp justified all the walk I had done. I was completely overwhelmed by the view of the majestic Himalayan peaks from the summit. Losing my sense of self, I wished for time to stand still and it felt like I could look at them forever. Initially, I wished I could fly through the large distance between me and those peaks, touch them and come back. But when I realised that I was tired from the climb and it was such a huge distance, I felt overpowered by the reality of nature I was witnessing. My ego dissolved in that moment and at once, I was completely thoughtless.  While starting to climb down, I took one final look at those peaks and bid them goodbye with a tearful eye. I still do not know what was the whole point of climbing the mountain, but I am pretty sure that there was something about it that touched my soul and it was this very thing that maintained the rhythm of my walk and provided me the strength to continue.
The trek went really good. The trek leader Dushyant was very friendly and gave instructions at every step. I would definitely remember the stories he told us at different points during the journey. He helped identify the North star and Sirius using the Orion constellation. He also told us about his fascinating experience during the Roopkund trek. Our general knowledge was also tested at the summit! 😊 At the summit, he helped identify the prominent peaks that were visible, which included the Bandarpunch, Kalanag, Swargarohini and Nanda Devi peaks. He told us about the story behind the Nanda Devi summits, which was quite interesting. The local guide Sachin also helped me during the steep snow sections near the summit. When I got nervous during the steep sections, he encouraged me for doing very good as a first-time trekker. Personally, I was surprised I could maintain my pace both while ascending and descending, even though I felt a lot of pain in my legs for 1-2 days after reaching home. Overall, the trek was a thrilling experience and I am definitely heading to the mountains in near future for more such experiences. As I am also working on improving my stamina, I hope to do longer and difficult treks in future.
I liked that the tents were already pitched when we reached the base camp since I was tired, even though I felt that we missed the useful opportunity to learn how to pitch a tent. The camps were good and the sleeping bag was also comfortable. I also didn’t get to know any issue with the camps or the sleeping bags from anyone.
Our pulse and BP were checked at the base camp. We were also provided with microspikes for maneuvering the snow sections. The group was lead in the front by the local guide and at the end by the trek leader. Instructions were also issued at the start regarding properly tying the shoes, fastening the rucksack and holding and using the trekking pole. Overall, I feel that the standards were good.
Two points really stood out for me, through this trek with Indiahikes.
1.    Sharing of trekking experiences, making the same trek free in future and encouraging DIY treks
The trek leader shared many experiences, specially at the beginning of the trek. His fascination for trekking was contagious. He even encouraged us to do treks on our own and gave us tips for the same. Indiahikes’ policy of making the same treks free in future is also very good and encourages me to continue trekking with you.
2.  Concern for the mountain environment
As someone moved by environmental concerns, I really appreciate Indiahikes’ policy of Green Trails. I picked as much wrappers I could pick and yet, I felt I could do more. I remember that I had to overlook many wrappers just because I didn’t have the energy to bend down and pick them up. I definitely plan to work on this on my future treks. You should continue with this policy as it helps clean the precious mountain environment.

Holla!
I can write pages and pages about the trekking experience and overall activity had with Indiahikes.
I long wanted to do high altitude trek. And this is how I got to know about Indiahikes.
I choose Brahmatal trek don't know why but once I have done my trek I believed that I was meant to be at Brahmatal-.
I made amazing friends in the trek, got connected with the mother nature, got sense of accomplishment and motivation after the trek. 
The trek leader Mr.Akshay is one Super soul. He helped me through the entire trek and made sure I don't give up and complete the Summit. Cheers !
The views from Tilandi, Jhandi top and the Summit is amazing. They take you to the actual summit. 
The gears, tents and the safety protocols they follow is really good.
I am happy with my experience and I have made amazing memories for lifetime
Also they(Mr.Akshay) made sure that on the day of my birthday a celebration was put up. Was so sweet and close to my heart.
Green Trains: The change is in me. The wrappers go in my pocket after I have come down to my city unlike earlier.

My India Hikes experience was just amazing. I noticed that you take the four value pillars very seriously and make sure you provide with the best to the trekkers. my experience with green tails had been very good. I now know how much of a pollution we cause and how people are careless when it comes to plastic consumption. I have understood all the hazardous waste that is dumped into our mountains causes harm not just to us but also to the entire eco-system. I actively participated in the green tails initiative during the trek and I feel this will remain with me for good. definitely is life changing. It has made me aware of my plastic consumption and now I try and reduce it to the maximum. It has automatically made me aware of what could be a much healthy and a sustainable alternative to all the hazardous waste that is being produced. Kudos to such a wonderful initiative.
 I have learnt a lot about trekking on this trek. All thanks to the wonderful Trek leader and the local guides who accompanied us to the trek.Our trek leader Nitesh was extremely experienced. His love for nature and the zeal to preserve it was evident. He was well informed and took very good care of all of us during the trek. A word of appreciation to the local guides who had accompanied us. They were very friendly and also experienced. They lead us all the way up and back to our basecamp with utmost care.

From trekking in rain to snowfall, we experienced everything one would expect coming on a winter trek. We had such amazing trek guides and Aayushi, our trek leader was so energetic and motivating.Bonding with the people around me is what stood out for me the most. Talking to the guides about the culture and food in these places, about their previous trek experience. Making a good rapport with the technical guide on our summit day and having sliding race on our way back from the summit. 
A sense of accomplishment on the summit , that if I could do this despite all the bad weather our team had to face in the last 3 days then I can tackle any problem that I may face in my life ahead. Just the feeling of being mentally strong. Talking to the guides who are locals of that place and listening to their stories and folklore was such a thrilling experience. Knowing what happened in a place even before trekking existed in these mountains was so amazing and once-in-a-lifetime. 
Trek Coordinator, Prathima ma'am was so prompt and always kept us well informed. She was making sure we were prepared for the bitter cold weather by sending us videos and telling us what all to carry. After my trek I was just waiting to go back and write to her about this wonderful experience that I had.

My experience with India hikes was a really good one. As this was first solo trek or trip i would say it didn't felt like a solo cause the people I met on this trek gelled up so well that it came out as an awesome experience. And the food was delicious specially the deserts I never expected that. 
I know allot about the trek as a trek with India Hikes is a learning experience and it left me with many things.
I got a lot of information from experience coordinators and that helped allot in packing stuff and all.
Green Trails me think more about sustainability as the the methods used by India hike were something to get learning from as one would have never thought that you can save so much water while cleaning your plates and all . the eco bag system was really good as it revolves around the fact that we are leaving mountains cleaner and what is better than that

I’m glad to jot down this review and think it’s overdue for the wonderful experience that was mesmerizing as well as informative. I can't describe the feeling which I am returned with! Being a Canadian and stuck herein lockdown in India, this trek was very much needed when I’m going through a very difficult time in India. I had done hiking before in Canada and the US. But this time, my patriotism calling me and I really want to start my Trekking Journey, and what’s the best way other than the Himalayas to start with! 
IndiaHikes made my journey smoother and possible at every strep. This was the very first trek of my life. My journey starts with staying extra 2 days at beautiful Gaichwan Gaon (base camp). Seeing the teams coming from the summit and leaving for the summit, I’ll never forget those stories and faces. With IH, everything was organized perfectly from the pick up to every detail, including food, accommodation, guiding, and providing the information. Brilliant team IndiaHikes. Thanks to Gaurab da, Abhishek, Akshay, Ayushi, and Parthy Anna (my trek leader) was amazing, I met them during my 2 days' extra stay at base camp. Special THANKS to Parthi Anna for his professionalism in trekking. In Parthi a trek leader, you have a great administrator who not only ensures the safety of his Trekkers but also manages the support staff with dexterity. With Parthi around, I knew nothing could happen to me and others, on this challenging trek. He is true Mountain Man and real Hima-Lion. soft-spoken, always on the move, and disciplined. You have a real gem in Parthi in your team, preserve him.  Exceptional efforts made by IH to made our Journey smoother and memorable. My message will remain incomplete if I don't mention the Cook and helper (Mahaveer dada, Labu da, Santosh da, and Bhagwan Singh Uncle) especially. They were such a great example who practices their work as worship. Feeding using such a harsh winter and Motivating, Inspiring and Supporting us all all the way, was much needed for moral support. They took care of us like their child in the snow. 
I had teary eyes at the Summit on New Year 2021, I will never forget and meant so much to me and has a special feeling which I take back a very rich experience, merely can't be expressed in words. This trek taught me so much about myself. I shall cherish forever and every moment rest of my life. Can't wait for another adventure ""Goechala"" before I leave for Canada. Thank You IndiaHikes!
coming from Western Countries, we do focus a lot on Trash. How to segregate the Trash way before in mind when we do shopping, when we have this awareness, we will buy less plastic bags or plastic containers or plastic package dry-foods items. Then you will produce Zero-Waste. Also, I'm practicing Reuse, Recycle a lot in my day-to-day life. I know people were sharing their thoughts on this on trek time, but actually a few handfuls of only practicing afterward when they left the border of vacation.
Instead, it should be like a Pledge to Ourselves and to Our Future. And try to teach your other family members, especially the kids, they only learn when they see us doing it, giving a lecture to them or anybody is not going to work.

I had such a good experience with indiahikes that I don't think I'm ever even going to look out for any other option. Right from booking the trek to the last night. I was most impressed by all the activities we did on the trek and apart from that ofc, green trails. I plan to continue this green drive in my city life as much as I can.
This was the best thing that I took back to city here. So much so, I think it(Green trails) ought to be a part of our daily lives as well. I'm trying to start something like ""ecobricking club"" here in delhi. I know it's not much, but I'd still like to try.
I've already ordered an eco bag from indiahikes. Apart from that, I am cutting down on all packaged products(particularly chips and maggi) as much as I can. And ofc, I take my own cutlery and mug to the college now when earlier there wasn't a day I could stay away from canteen food. And I tried spreading this message of bringing their own cutlery and mugs to my friends in college and a lot of people who I know through instagram and whatsapp. Well, I know it's not much, just a small effort on my part for green trailsthat I brought back from the trek.

Firstly, I was glad to know that there is such a setup provided in India which makes you trek with all the necessities and even takes care of the environment. So, really appreciate the initiative and hence will promote Indiahikes in my network followed by continuing trekking with Indiahikes.
There were a few things that I would like to mention from my experience of Dayara Bugyal trek done in the batch of 30th December 2020 to 4th January 2021:
1. I really appreciate your eco bags and Dry composite toilet initiative for being so considerate towards the ecosystem.
2. Every day the meals and snacks were on time. The team does a commendable job even after doing the trek and setting up the tents every day they were bang on time.
3. Taking no music while trekking policy, so that the meaning of trekking is not defeated in addition to keeping the ecosystem in the natural condition.
Green Trails is one of the best initiatives I have come across, I really appreciate.  
In the end, I'm thankful for Indiahikes for giving such a wonderfully safe and sound environment to trek. I will be continuing to trek with Indiahikes.

It is always a great experience with indiahikes and this trek was no different. Every organisation is built around its people, and in the case of indahikes, the people is its real strength, everyone from the kitchen staff to the trek leader truly make you feel welcome and as part of the trekking family. The trek leader Ravi was also a constant source of new and fun information. A special note to the kitchen staff as well who prepared a cake for us on New Year’s Day at about 10,000 feet, that is no easy task! 
 We were also given basic training on navigation, though it ended up being led by a few and the information did not end up being shared evenly across all trekkers. That aside, there were very useful tips and tricks for trekking and also experience and knowledge sharing sessions, from not just the trek leader but also from the guides, which I will take forward into my next treks, and I and definitely better off for it! 
When it came to Green Trails, Indahikes had already done a great job on the trail, we did not have the chance to pick up a lot of waste, but whatever little we did find we ensured to pick up. Ravi sir was a great example to learn from during the trek. The talks that he had on how important our roles are in saving the environment was one of the main highlights of the trek for me. When you learn from someone who loves nature as much as he does, it is definitely unique. 
Even though Prathima and myself have had very limited interaction, what I can say is she kept the group active and excited for the trek right from the very beginning, sharing useful insights into the trek and also organising a meet and greet with the leadership at IH as a step in right direction towards our mental preparedness. 
One piece of feedback I would share is when asking for reasons to come on the trek or other such questions, I feel that these may be best saved for during the trek, as more open and honest conversation would be possible around these topics only during the trek itself.

the way Indiahikes take care of mountains and trekkers gives confidence to trekkers to come again and again with Indiahikes. The people working with Indiahikes are very passionate and they follow all rules and regulation what they have made to take care of the mountain while trekking and safety precaution. I like the way they are connecting people to the mountains. Green Trails:- The one I like most because it enables us to give a little contribution to make a mountain clean and take back all plastic or waste from the mountain and place it in the right place.. like recycling, etc. so it makes me feel confident that we left the mountains better than we found them.Thank you Indiahikes for this wonderful experience.
They guys are amazing they help people with every step starting from preparation to trough out all trek. like what you have to carry how you have to carry, all info about the trek and while we are trekking they tell us lots of stories and facts about mountains.

This is the first trek I am doing in my life and honestly, I think I chose the best team to start my experience with. From the day we arrived at the base camp, the trek leader and the supporting staff made us feel comfortable and secured. It was like they were with us all the time during the trek. The activities like hugging a tree made us feel more connected to nature, and the forethought to bring paper and pen so that the trekkers could really capture what they were feeling on the summit truly made a difference. These are maybe a small part of the bigger picture, but these moments made the bigger picture memorable and I don't believe you would get the same experience with other groups. So, thanks for this wonderful experience. 

About Green Trails, I started thinking about the ways in which I can stop using more plastic. And I have actually made few changes in my lifestyle now.
This being my first trek, the tips shared in mail from the Experience coordinator each day for three weeks helped me prepare both mentally and physically and buying the required equipment.

Trekking with IndiaHikes is one of the best decisions I have ever made. Your focus on making this a memorable experience for each individual requires a huge applause. The dedication is evident in the care taken to prepare each meal, in the patience shown in being with us and taking care even if one of us is walking at a slower pace, the list goes on.
The trek left me overwhelmed and emotional at more than one instance. One special incident has to be mentioned. On our second day of the Kedarkantha trek, after we reached Pukhrola base camp, our trek leader Akshay told us that he'll take us to visit a sunset spot. That was one of the most magical sights I have ever seen in my life. The purest stretch of snow, the brook flowing gracefully beside it, the trees standing tall at a distance, the majestic array of mountains in varying shades of blue and grey as far as you can see, and the golden sun almost ready to shower the prettiest rays of the day... To say I was overwhelmed would still be an understatement. I cried, couldn't stop it. It was a moment of pure gratitude, for being alive, for being able to witness this beauty and for all the precious things I have in my life that I take for granted. That sight is something I'll remember for as long as I am alive. I cant thank Akshay, our sweeper-guide Kush bhaiyya and the whole of IndiaHikes team for giving me that moment. 
Taking part in GreenTrails was a beautiful experience. It reminded me that inspite of the beauty and majesty, the mountain ecosystem is still fragile. We need to be much much much more careful with how much of a footprint we're leaving behind. And thanks to GreenTrails it gives me the reassurance that not only did we prevent creation of new waste but also left the trail better than we found it. And the consciousness it has instilled in all of us is an added advantage to carry back to our cities. I am trying to be more conscious about the impact of each of my actions and each of my purchases. I have switched to menstrual cup after coming back from the trek which is a small yet positive way to start reducing my footprint. I am also reading IndiaHikes articles on GreenTrails, they provide valuable insights on how we can switch to less polluting ways in our daily lives. 
 Prathima's timely emails and messages, we would have been seriously underprepared for our trek. Her emails covered every aspect from what to pack, how to reach the destination, how to get fit and experiences from other trekkers. She was also available to answer all of our queries at any given time. We were physically and mentally prepared for this, thanks to the timely and proactive guidance of our coordinator.

My trek experience was fantastic. I would like to appreciate Indiahikes and the Trek leader Guru and Guides (Deep and Bobby) for their dedication and special mention to the kitchen staff who prepared Birthday cake for me and my wife in such harsh conditions. Kudos! to them. They made it very special for us. And the trek itself was so beautiful and mesmerizing. Made lot of new friends! Witnessed my first ever snowfall. Loved the overall trek experience.
When it comes to Green Trails, it was really nice to see something being done to preserve the nature and its beauty. Yes, we did our best to leave mountains in much better condition than we found them.  I will try to inculcate it in my daily life as much as I can. I am highly impressed with Green trails benefits.
Because of the information and continuous coordination I am much more aware now what is a real trek experience.

The safety attribute, the guidance, the experience of local guides was excellent.
The trek seems very short for a 4-day trek. Maybe because it's a beginner trek? An experienced trekker such as myself would be able to complete the trek in 2 days - day 1 go from raithal to chillapada, day 2 take the summit and trek down back to raithal.
Also, the experience coordinators were very helpful and informative and assisted with every query.

143,VARSHA ARUN,2020-12-01,Kedarkantha Trek,"
This was my 2nd trek with Indiahikes and while both treks were fantastic, this one stood out for me for a few reasons. Firstly, the trek, needless to say, was incredibly beautiful. The west facing campsites ensured each sunset was better than the previous one. We were the fortunate batch to do a sunset summit to avoid crowd. HANDS DOWN, THIS WAS BETTER THAN ANY FORM OF MEDITATION. The climb, the views, the freezing weather.. it was all worth it once we got to see the peaks in all their glory from the top. The skies were clear and we got to spend a quiet 60 minutes on the summit after a long day of trekking. One word, PRICELESS. We also got to experience snowfall on our last day and it was amazing to see how everything around us felt surreal!!
Secondly, our trek leader Tanmay Bain exceeded expectations. He was extremely professional, helpful and such a fun person overall. He'd give us information about the trek, clouds, his travels and in general was very curious about every member of the group. The manner in which he shouldered responsibility of our group needs to be highly appreciated.
Thirdly, the changes made by Indiahikes from last year like introducing an app to monitor health information as opposed to the older health cards is a great upgrade. The new 3-sink system for washing dishes consuming less water is absolutely novel. The KAZI Thermos ensured we had warm drinking water throughout. What was even better is that we got to hear about it from Kazi Bhai himself at Gaichawan Gaon. 
Last, but certainly not the least, the food was, for the lack of better words, mind-blowing! Appreciate how food is not just given to keep us full, but how thoughtfully the menus are curated according to what we have planned for the day. Those Gulab Jamuns were the best I've had so far! Huge thank you to all the kitchen staff, our local guides Roop Mohan Ji and Aryan who were just as friendly and helpful, the slop manager Gaurav, the mule staff, the extremely insightful articles on the blog, Prathima our experience coordinator and to the entire back-end team that strives to deliver an experience of a lifetime! Thank you Prathima for tirelessly sending those extremely helpful emails from 30 days before the trek. This clarified most of our questions ( trust me we had a lot of questions because it was a winter trek!!) about packing layers and most importantly, helped us train better. The trek went off smoothly because we were well equipped with all necessary information about it :)
It was appalling to see how something so pristine could be so polluted. Kudos to your entire Green Trails team for this fantastic initiative of leaving the mountains better than we found them. As a group of 19, we did do our bit and GOD DID IT FEEL GREAT! Thank you for encouraging sustainable living and reinstating the fact that less is definitely more. the amount of plastic we consume at home,inspired by you, we have slowly started the transition towards plastic-free way of life. 
Buying groceries in bulk, making bio enzymes at home for cleaning, not picking up packaged food.. I believe this trek is exactly what we needed to implement these changes at home! Thank you again.

it was a great experience with IH the food served to us was very tasty and hearty and at that hight with that freezing temperature the food served was freshly cooked and warm. the trek leader KRUPA VYAAS and the guides DEV BHAI & KUSH LOVE were great help. they were always standing next to us for any help. I never thought that that trek will be that easy for me but with the great help of IH team. the tents and sleeping bags are very neat and clean also the location of the camping was great as it used to be sunny during the day times on the tents and very less of wind during the nights also the equipments provided by IH team were pretty good as that made trekking in snow and on ice pretty easy. this was my first trek and it was finished two days back only and I am already planning for another trek with you guys in January for brahmaltal trek. also there is a suggestion from my side that you guys should have some membership system like yearly or lifetime with which the trekker can do all the treks he want to do with you guys by just paying the total membership fees upfront. 
thanks guys for such a great experience.the green trails is a great initiative taken by the IH team and it has taught me a a great lesson of keeping my waste along with myself and keeping our mountains clean and green and this was strictly followed by all of our group as our trek leader was pretty strict on this point and I feel its a great thing,also it has changed my habit of throwing the wrappers on the roads and in the surroundings.trek coordinators really played a big role in completing the trek as each and every time they ask for our good help and keep checking our blood pressure,heart rate and oxygen and if der is anything wrong then guides us how to maintain the same. also keeps us reminding to keep ourself hydrated all the times and so on.

There are lot of things which stood out :

2) 5 minutes of silence in jungle. 
3) Post card to write experience.
4) Get together at camp side and chit-chat with Trek Leaders(Akshay,Dabbu bhai and Prahlad bhai) and other team mates .
5) Food was awesome throughout the trek. Thanks to all the staff of India hikes for arranging such tasty meals on mountains.
Trek information was too good. The mailers which we received before starting of the trek helped a lot and trek leader also provided valuable inputs regarding selecting a campsite and other details.So information provided was really very helpful.Prathima who helped with each and every query i had and i was able to clear all my doubts related to transport and what to carry and what will be already included(e.g. Micro spikes and gaiters) that helped me not to take anything extra and keep my luggage light.
Green trail has impacted a lot and now when i'm back to home.I made sure that i segregate the waste and ensure to reduce the usage of plastic.

This was by far the best experience I've ever had. Right from the tents, the method of water insulation, the trek leader, guides to the scenic beauty witnessed, the activities conducted, and the reflection sessions. Everything stands out in a different corner of my mind. All the beauty and physical aspects of the trek are on one side; the learning is what struck a chord with me. There was something for everyone. Obviously, we can't learn everything in one go, but I feel like every single trekker had at least one takeaway from the entire experience. 
Mine was humility. Up there in the high mountains, I realized how small my problems, my successes, or for that matter even I am. Being an IITian, there are times when my ego gets the best of me. But I feel like this experience has helped me a lot in that area. 
Indiahikes also had a large part to play in this. There was this activity which was conducted in which a rope was tied across two trees at about shoulder height, each team was asked to hold hands and cross that rope from over it without touching it. None of us could figure out how to do it. That is when I felt so humiliated that even though all of us were IITians, even collectively we couldn't figure out the solution to a simple problem. So thank you Indiahikes :).
I'd suggest taking a small angithi or something like that to warm up the trekkers in the evenings. Also, I feel that warm water should be given more than twice a day. 
Other than that, the trek experience, please don't change anything. It's absolutely perfect.
Also, about green trails, it felt really good to be able to be a small part of conserving nature. It definitely stimulated my mind in a more sustainable direction, but I feel that we've been living in cities for so long, and a 4-day trek can only do so much. It's gonna take 2 to 3 treks more before actual lifestyle changes start happening.
I'd like to thank Izzat ma'am, so so so much for everything. Seriously. 
I don't think that the trek would have been what it was without you. The reflection sessions, your unending enthusiasm throughout the trek, the late-night story sessions, everything was just surreal.
You were an inspiration to all of us throughout the trek and even beyond it. I hope to go on many more treks with you. 
Again, thank you.

I have been on 5 other treks with Indiahikes over the past 3.5 years. What has stood out for me was that despite Covid and the other challenges faced in 2020, IH was able to maintain the trek experience quality. In times like this most organizations find it easier to take shortcuts and blame the drop-off on external factors.
Special kudos to the team and founders for not sacrificing their core values during these difficult times. It takes a special kind of bravery to do this.
I would like to share one particular incident that stood out to me about GT during the trek. On our last day, as we exited Gorson Bugyal to enter Auli, we encountered a huge crowd of tourists and an extremely littered trail. Despite a few snide comments from passerbys, our team continued to pick up the trash until most of our eco-bags were full.
A majority of our group members were first time trekkers and to not feel shy or embarrassed about picking up trash in front of strangers, I realized what a deep impact the values of Green Trails had on them. Special credit should go to our TL, Suhas, to have communicated this so effectively to our batch.

Thanks to our Trek leader (Suhas), guide (Soham ji), the sweeper (Harish ji), Trek coordinator (Prathima), the entire cooking crew &  the supporting staff who made the journey extremely enjoyable! I guess we had utmost fun and we shared a meaningful connection with each and every member in the trek, because of the values & sweetness that the India hikes staff emanate!
1. @Basecamp the common values agreement exercise with the entire team, helped us keep up decorum.
2. Green trails - the true alignment of it with the Indiahikes team members, inspired us even more.
3. Everyday gratitude circle, vulnerability circle, and fun activities like making the snow man and playing cards.. made us bond well..
4. Indiahikes team built us an intangible safe space to be ourselves, to trek at our own pace (managing us very gracefully)
5. Safety measures & the Quick response when one of our fellow trekker fell ill was amazing.. and they actually supported her way back to the base camp again! Incredible support system!
6. Very strong 'empathy game!' Right from registering for the trek, throughout the four days of intense trek, farewell & beyond, the support & vibe of Indiahikes was energizing!
7. Project zero - where we said we wouldn't use one item that we brought for the trek as extra/ unnecessary.. made me restructure my thinking style, to really think before consuming a product.
Loved trekking with IH, would do it all over again!
Definitely we did feel that we left the mountains better than we found them.. we also left as more responsible human beings than how we came in..!
It really made me question the way I consume & generate waste!
This was my first trek altogether. It was also a winter trek, solo trek and a Himalayan trek. But I didn't get cold feet at all. My entire preparation period was strongly supported by 'Trek with Swathi's' videos of how to prepare for the trek & Prathima's mails, helping us get well trained & equipped!
Indiahikes website has by far been the most impressive website, where all the information is shared in a very user friendly manner, and I really felt confident & was excited to trek with IH!
Prathimba Chabbaria was my Experience coordinator. She was extremely supportive and her mails were really helpful for me to prepare for the trek. Though my registration got through only two weeks before the trek; she did support me over the call & mail, and was an immense mental support as well.
I feel the trek has made me more sensitive to waste, than I was earlier. I'm now more mindful about how much waste we generate & how we discard them at home. Looking at poor waste management system, makes me want to be the change. Still a long way to go.. But I shall start little.

Well! I am a proud fan of India hikes. With every trek you make feel much stronger about this. Kuari pass was different on the experiential front. Suhas, who was our trek lead conducted some activities like hugging the tree, writing down thoughts while on the mountains etc made the trek so much more valuable.
A big Thanks to Suhas and the entire team who made this experience truly memorable.
Not to forget the other old values IH lives of which is sustainability, partnership with Greentrails etc. So glad that all of this is being done with the same sincerity with which it was started.    
Very happy to have partnered in the Green trails effort of keeping mountains cleaner. It is a shame that we have put our mountains in this condition today.
While I love the way IH brings the awareness and shares knowledge with trekkers, I feel it would be beneficial to bring similar awareness and realization to the locals / villagers. Im sure this is being done but wanted to just reiterate.
 IH always has detailed information about treks. The informative videos, posts blogs etc make IH so much more valuable and distinct than any other trek organizers.
Also the local guides take time and give their side of story / regional beliefs which is a again so special.
I just love the way Experience Coordinators function. I was so relieved when I realised its  Prathima this time because she was the coordinator for my very first IH trek as well. The kind of patience and healthy interaction I have had with Prathima is unmatched. Hearty Thank You to Prathima and other members on the team for prepping us so well. We should share credits of our summits first with you.  
It has certainly changed the way I think and live. I avoid any kind of plastic usage even in cities. Inevitably if I end up using it really makes me feel very uncomfortable. That's the kind of impact IH and Green Trails has has on me.
One instance I should share here was - while I was picking up litter in Auli, a local guys (sarcastically) asked me if I make money by picking up thrash and how much do i get paid for picking up thrash :) I could sense he was trying to make fun of me but that's didnt affect me one bit because I was doing it with all my heart.

Completely echo on the values which India hikes carry – especially stands very strong on “create unique trek experiences”, “Relationship comes above business” and “adds meaning to our lives. Action speaks more than words for IH Team and personally every individual who comes for trek and be part of this family will definitely experience this. To list down we will have a huge list. However to highlight – 
•    during the course of this  trek , the information what trek leads share -historically/ geographically about the places is beyond expectation . This shows the knowledge they possess / the effort which has been taken to gather the details. Kudoos to the IH team.
•    Irrespective of the pace in which an individual take to trek during the course of the trek, the support for the IH team gives / extend is again beyond expectation. Generally trek leads would push more to match the pace of the whole group. However here IH leads give that breathing space for an individual  to pick up good pace ensuring the trekker simultaneously enjoy and experience the beauty of nature/ essence of trek. This has been one of the plus point. 
•    Adding their own essence during the trek  by trek leads -  like this time we experienced (1) hugging a tree. This probably every individual might have done in their childhood while paying. But the experiencing it/ the feel of it is different when we di that activity (2) giving a pen and a sheet or paper to pen down our thoughts/ after doing the summit. THIS HAS BEEN BEYOND WORDS. Thanks to Trek lead for giving us this experience. These things might look funny for few, until one experience it. 
•    Unknowingly IH team captivates the heart (core of heart) of every individual by the knowledge / by health and safety measures / by  their gesture and  warmth / what they show in  each and every step what they take to ensure the trek gets the BEST experience for lifetime. ( on a lighter note- even if some one wants to try for any other adventure group, mind and heart will not let go off …. )
•    Taking care of every individuals  like a family member by ensuring on every aspects like – 
o    health monitoring – oximeter check / BP / any alarming issues
o    providing good and hot food especially few of the dishes which are required for such weather condition and give stamina to trek 
o     sleeping bags ( as the temp was quite low and was hard to manage with one sleeping bag, IH provided one more bag (jakhana) along with their normal hospitality
List goes on….. The professionalism, the discipline what IH carry without hampering passion what individual has is really commendable. to cut it short – trek with IH is indeed an experience for life time for me. This has been  my 2nd trek with IH…. Looking forward for more and more. 
Green trials – Thanks for this initiative by IH. Thanks might be a very small word . This initiative has taken IH to a different level of respect . For those who would like to contribute but didn’t know how or have not done in the past , this initiate give us an opportunity for it. The effort  which IH team takes it to ensure on segregation and  re-usage of these wastes in the right way is praiseworthy . This surely has impacted  us/ individuals  to carry the practise off the trek in day today life too/. Kudoos to team for this initiative to ensure we keep our mother nature as pure and healthy as she was before.

152,Prem Kavathiya,2020-12-01,Brahmatal Trek,"
First of all, i would like to congratulate Indiahikes on finding such an amazing team which carried out our trek seamlessly. This trek was one of the best trips i have ever experienced in my life. Everything was well organised beforehand be it the trek routes, food, quizzes, games or the green trails. Our trek leader was extremely trained and i enjoyed his company a lot on the trek. I would like to point out that the food provided was too good and also the concept of ‘leaving mountains better than we found them’ struck me hard.
So this was not a ‘problem’ or an ‘issue’ but i would have liked to have a huge bag to carry waste from mountains because we found huge piles of wastes on our way back to base camp which i was unable to clear just due to shortage of space in eco bags.
Green trails was the most fascinating thing for me on the trail. It got ingrained so deeply into me that even while walking on my cityroads i felt my hands going towards wrappers to pick them up. I can assure you that our team left mountains better than we found them.

My kedarkantha trek with India hikes was just incredible. I will surely run out of words. This is easily the most challenging trek for me since its my first winter trek and the weather has not been our friend. With temperatures ranging in minus and campsites surrounded with snow and winds, specially after sunset when nights can be really really hard, India hikes crew brought a lot of warm by updating us with all necessary information. Minor details as simple as when to layer and how to was told. Not just told for the sake of telling us as their responsibility but they also kept monitoring and reminding us as to when to change into more layers. That was special care that trek leaders- Krupa and Aayushi along with prahlad bhai showing great leadership and delivering way beyond their responsibility. 
What the whole team of india hikes did was commendable. I would love to trek with you guys again and prepare better for a winter trek. Change in trail and summiting from the westerns side of kedarkantha was also a special since there was no crowd at all. And kudos to India hikes for curating such special experiences for their trekkers.

The trek was amazing, the trail made it more adventurous and breathtaking; I indulge the company of the nature and people; those weren't just teammates or fellow trekkers, it was an extended family; we had  a lot of fun; at the basecamp as well as trekking through the trails. the stops on the trek were amazing; as a team we did really well, Vivek was out trek leader and he organized activities to bolster out teamwork and morale; even our trek guide Pankaj was very supportive; everyone was amiable and kind; those were well invested days; the trek surely impacted me physically, mentally and spiritually like it was already promised

The trek was great. All your services were really good. All of us trekkers really enjoyed the whole experience. But the only thing that I did not enjoy very much was the Ruinsara Tal. Although the route was good, but after reaching to the Ruinsara, it didn't feel like it. I'm sure Ruinsara must be a great location in all the other season, but I didn't feel like it was perfect for this month.
There are many good things to say about you people. A big thanks to all the people working at India Hikes for all the trekkers to give them the best experience right from the time we book our trek, then at the pick up point, at the base camp and while on the trek. I would also like to tell that the Green Trails initiative is going to go a long way, it's a great work by India Hikes and all of us trekkers felt really resoponsible for travelling to the Mountains.

The trek went really well. I'd been to another trek with a different organization and let me tell you the difference in approach for everything is sooo much. Had I not tried Indiahikes, I'd not known that such a positive, well thought and planned approach for a trek is even possible. Smallest to biggest things were thought of. Nothing came to us as a shock or something which we werent prepared for. I experienced such a warm hospitality from you guys that it didnt seem like a professional / corporate organization just wanting to attract people for their profits.
 
I guess, everyone is going to thank the trek leader, trek coordinator, slope manager etc for the wonderful experience, but I'd like to express my sincere gratitude to the cooks on the trek. Manishji and his team were such magicians with all the wonderful meals they made for us. Who would have thought that we would get such delicious hot meals including DESSERTS on a trek!!!! They made it with such love and warmth that we could literally feel it in our meals. 
A special mention on an incident which really touched my heart was when Manishji made sure to keep a separate vegan meal for our trek leader coz he knew Krupa doesnt eat Ghee. Krupa told us that she didnt tell him to do it as she would have eaten the non vegan meal anyway but he still did it even without anyone telling him to. These small gestures made me really appreciate the team which you are building for Indiahikes. These are really warm and kind people on your team and we trekkers appreciate them. Due to COVID situation we werent allowed to meet the Kitchen staff or else id told them personally too. Please convey my sincere regards to the team.

Our trek Leader Krupa helped a lot in the trek and she took care of us when we were not feeling well. Krupa shared a lot of information about trekking and we cared together on the trek. India hikes staff did a great job in trek for cooking healthy food. 
I am very thankful to our trek leader Krupa and slope manager Gaurav for making this trek memorable to us.  They did a great job and they ensured every trekker to be safe in the trek.

The trek went quite well, I must say with lot of fun and learning's . 
The weather and the trails were absolutely amazing and views were just mesmerizing.
Thanks for the dates , that suited so well.
One suggestion that came to my mind, was the fitness level of fellow trekkers,
Though you ask people to submit their fitness report by walking , running or cycling in a given time frame,
But looking at the fitness level of few of the fellow trekkers, I felt that they were quite short of the required fitness levels, which slowed the speed of others and more attention was given to their health .
There were many good things in the trek. A few of them I am sharing here.
1. My quest to conquer the highest peak was fulfilled when I climbed Tapovan, not just that I reached first from our batch on the top, but with a good speed and stamina. 
So my self-belief and confidence went high up.
2.While descending down , I was given the responsibility by the trek leader to ensure that the last person must come down safe, so while descending I ensured that my fellow trekker who was partially not well and less equipped, must reach down safely with me- irrespective of the time it takes.
So that was a high satisfaction point , when you make others feel comfortable and create bondings.
3. Our Trek leader - Akshay Upreti is a gem. He is a true leader in all senses. Its not the energy levels and the support that he provided to each individual member but he ensured that through out the trek we introspect and learn from this trek . He not only engaged us with inspiring stories and personal notes , to keep our motivation high but also gave exemplary show whenever there was crisis.
In addition Deepak ( Depu Bhai) the fellow trek leader too was superb and never saw a sign a pain or frustration on any single day / moment.. thats what keeps us moving....Cheers

On talking about the negatives, 1.Instead of trekking 2 km a day, 5 km a day and massive 14km a day, you can sort it out and make some average distance for each day which will be more easier to walk.
2.After completion of each day's trek give the individual some time for their own to roam around and spend time instead of calling suddenly to dining tent to chit-chat. 
1.The amazing trek leader tanmay was the first good thing.
2.The food was really fantastic. 
3.The facilities were more than sufficient.

From the pick up to the last day of trek everything went well.  Trek leader was an amazing guy, he was with full of energy and I never saw him down with energy. Because of him team members mingled and we became good friends by end of the trek.  We all enjoyed knowledge sharing by Tanmay (emergency rescue stretcher making, Medicines, 5 minutes with nature when we reached Har Ki dun peak, his life experiences during trek and travel etc) Every day we gather enthusiastically around Tanmay to hear his stories.  He made our trek fun and he always start and end the day with prayer, warm ups and cool down. Have lot to say about Damru, such an amazing guy.  Have no complaints about food. None of the team had any sort of stomach upsets and any other sort of issues. Everyone enjoyed the variety of sweet they served. Honey lemon water,  Ajjawin water,  Ginger water served everyday. Special mention and Thanks to Rajesh, Gangaji,  Khajaan, Damru and Ajay. They always made sure to serve food hot and neat. A big thanks to them.

He motivated me to take up bigger challenges in life in general.
Slope manager Ravi educated us with the state of environment our world is in. He also guided us on the Meru view point descend.

 A groupmate of mine was having difficulty climbing and she felt like giving up on trek 3-4 times but she didn't give up and made it to the top. I realized how damn strong willpower she has. I felt proud to be part of such a strong tribe.

175,Aditya Roy Choudhury,2020-10-01,Gaumukh Tapovan,"
The trek was excellent. 
Immediate:
1. Revisit the Covid19 safety measures (31 points?) - intent vs ground reality vs long term practicality (consider atleast next 30 months) - from transportation, hotels, tents, trekkers accountability?
2. Stop spraying sanitizers inside tents, sleeping bags, etc - they are getting full of algae, mildew, mold, etc. That's equally/more dangerous for health. 
3. Nutrition (not just calories) needs to be immediately & comprehensively redesigned. It can't be the same for a 5 hrs day versus a 12 hrs summit trek day.
Medium Term:
4. Insurance documentation is poor & incomplete. Needs clarity.
5. Delighted to donate for Green Trails. But, a receipt should be issued. IndiaHikes must uphold its own high standards.
6. Stop being coy about tipping! Encourage 10% appreciation tips, post trek, by each trekker. Staff work extremely hard and look forward to the money.
7. BAN - any vehicle that has parallel seats at the rear. Sitting there for 10 hrs- is known to cause long term injuries to the back, neck and off course sudden impact injuries head and shoulders.
1. Trek Coordinator- Prathima - polite professional and timely communication. Authentic care, concern and problem solving attitude. What a rockstar!
2. Transport by Raju Shah - he is polite and his communication is precise. The vehicles are good, drivers excellent and >90% ontime for pickups and drops. Solid record. But - tell him to provide vehicles with straight (not parallel) rear seats. 
3. Trek Leader- breath of fresh air. Akshay, changed the definition of a stereotypical trek leader. Authenticity, humility, confidence while steadily bonding the team with daily self awareness sessions - Akshay belongs to a rare class of leadership. I express my deep gratitude to him for creating a unique and safe experience.
4. Guide & staff - using english adjectives to complement them would literally be an insult. Their endless hardwork and positive approach,  to make us comfortable and safe, is just exceptional. May the Almighty bless them.
5. Food quality - tasty, healthy, ontime, variety. Wow! 
6. Safety standards- oxygen & BP readings, health awareness, helmets, briefing, help by staff and Leader was very good.

The trek was amazing. 
Few things that needed a change was:
1. The amount to be paid to transporter was NOT ONLINE and they demanded cash, even when network was available. Due to cash crunch in wake of COVID, it was difficult. This can be arranged properly.
2. The place where we stayed in Sankri, KK palace, the toilet was not that clean. Even after complaining to the hotelier, not much was done. So the hotel management needs to be prompt. 
The team of India Hike is amazing.
Starting from the trek coordinator to the person we met on the trek, everyone was so helpful. 
The trek leader, Krupa, is an epitome of what leadership should be. She motivated us throughout the hardest patches in the trek, she kept us and treated us like a family. I had got blisters due to my shoes while walking, and my pace decreased, she waited for me to ascend the hardest section of Devsu Thatch. She made sure, that even though I did not have tea, i was arranged coffee or Haldi milk.

Trekked Phulara Ridge with TL Dawa Mathur and guide Mangal. It was an awesome experience, with the professionalism of IH being displayed in each and every activity, right from safety precautions for Covid to travel arrangements, food and accommodation. The demand for a Covid negative report by IH is very much valid, and during these times, every trekker should take the responsibility to get one. It brings about a huge sense of relief to know that fellow trekkers are not carrying the virus. The idea of an app for recording trekker details and other information is epic.
The views were awesome. Food was good, tasty and nutritious most of the times, though there was a little less variety sometimes. I guess it can be attributed to moving campsites. Kitchen staff was cooperative and provided all necessities on time. Mangal too was very helpful and caring, though a bit shy to interact much initially.

Though I noticed few changes. There was no feedback session after the end of the trek which happened in the 1st trek. I feel that was a very good platform to discuss not only about our experiences but also learn a lot from others experiences and the trek leader. If the change is due to covid, then it's okay. Else, please ensure it continues. And yes, there was no distribution of certificates. I'll love to have it. It's shows an achievement. Great it the hard copies of the certificates are stopped. It will save paper. E certificates will be great.
I'll take this moment to thank our Slope Manager to find a solution created because of the locals whoch could have stopped us from going to Tapovan. Being just a customer, it's not my concern, but I could see how IndiaHikes takes all efforts to ensure we have great experience. 
And no doubt IndiaHikes has great tram of trek leaders. Thanks to him who ensures and constantly motivated to ensure I complete the trek despite me having symptoms of AMS.

Overall the trek was an incredible experience. Especially considering the pandemic I didn't expect to feel so safe. But the IH team ensured that all the precautions were in place. We had a great time from Day 0 with stargazing, delicious food and a comfortable stay. 
The trek itself was exhilarating and very rewarding. All the campsites were in beautiful locations and I particularly liked the commitment towards cleaning the trail. It felt good to know that I was leaving it in a better state than before. 
We couldn't interact with the kitchen staff because of the social distancing norms but I want to mention that the food was great on all days.
Vijeet is a great trek leader and taught us so many things in the short duration of this trek. We had conversations on constellations, forests, and everything in between. There was always the emphasis on sustainability while trekking which is something all of us will keep in mind going forward. The cherry on top was all his stories from the mountains which meant there was never a dull moment on the trek.

The trek was really exciting and beautiful. I enjoyed every bit of it.
The slope manager Gaurab knows what he is doing. Since we reached the base camp at Sankri, everything went really smooth, mostly because of him.
Trek leader Tanmay explained everything we needed to know before the trek started. He even personally visited the members at their dorms/rooms to help them pack their backpacks! He is an angel.
Our team had some gifted cooks, including Nainaji. Food was great. One of our trek-mates had his birthday during the trek. The cooks had prepared a superb cake with sooji and coffee!!
Our team had the gifted guide: Pardeepji. He knows the local terrain extremely well. I was the slowest member of the team due to some complications I developed during the trek. Pardeepji was there with me almost all the time while remaining in touch with the team leader Tanmay via the walky. One day he even took away and carried my backpack since I was not making much progress with it. I am indebted to him for more than one reason.
Lastly, the trek-mates were also amazing and kind human beings. Each one of them helped me with the difficulties I was facing during the trek. I look forward to trek with this identical team over and over again.

There a few issues that I would like to bring to your notice
1. Picking up litter strewn across, and often even off the trail, is rather challenging since we carry our backpacks, trekking poles, and often wear gloves. I would like it if there was a way to pick up litter without having to bend/ crouch every so often. Also, the litter is often muddy and then we use the same hands to wipe sweat/ running noses!
2. It's okay to pick litter along the trail, but near tea stalls or in the villages, there is so much litter! I was over-whelmed by the sights. My new-found sense of responsibility towards keeping mountains clean and the impossibility of the task at hand was at odds.
 
The trek was a success, and I felt accomplished at the end. Thanks to the safety checks put in place by IH, I felt safe in spite of the Covid situation. The arrangements at the base camp helped me feel comfortable and relaxed even as I was excited and nervous about the trek. Our trek leader, Mr. Tanmay Bain is truly an amazing and very talented young man. Besides the right credentials, he has excellent soft skills. The chief cook, Nainabhai, along with Sukhdev bhai, limitations notwithstanding, came up with a variety of delicious and nutritious meals, and at a short notice even baked a perfect cake to celebrate a trekker's birthday! Pradeep bhai was thoroughly dedicated to his demanding job, guiding and helping us in many different ways while on the trail, and rushing to the other staffs' assistance as we approached the campsites. 
Every evening Tanmay would ask us for suggestions, and we used to point out issues, which he must have shared with the concerned officers. This was my first trek with IH, and what I liked was that right from the beginning, I was made to feel part of this family; that IH is here to encourage and help people  to trek, and not to make money; the Green Trails initiative is a wonderful campaign and I am glad that I was able to do my bit to keep mountains clean.

The trek went smoothly with some bumps along the way. I admire the determination and commitment of the India Hikes team to organize such a trek in pandemic times. There were some operational issues although. The dining tent was something, I felt was needed the most. Since everybody got themselves tested before the trek, it would not make sense to practice social distancing on treks at high altitudes. We also tried to reduce our contact with locals as much as possible. Overall, India Hikes never fails to impress me with their professionalism and good trek leaders.
I would like to thank Dhaval Jajjal for being a good trek leader. He is very passionate about the things he does. Also, Mr. Ravi was very supportive and pumped us before we left for the trek.

So 5 stars from my side. Kudos!
The effort the trek leader and support staff puts in to make the trek a life changing expirience for us is immense. Please share my blessings with Trek leader Dhaval, guide Pratap and head cook Khadak bhai and all other support staff. I especially loved the food. Hot food on mountains is a bliss!

The trek was awesome and the safety regulations taken as it was Corona time was simply stunning. Please change the pick-up point to Ashrey Sagar restaurant near Railway station. This is a much much better restaurant and Hotel compared to Grand legaccy. Room rates are cheaper(INR 900) compared to Grand legacy (INR 1500).
The trek was awesome and the safety regulations taken as it was Corona time was simply stunning. Trek leader Dhaval ji took extreme care in ensuring that every member's pulse oximeter reading is taken without fail (even at 4300 mts). Below things standout clearly.
1. Green Trails Idea was awesome. It inspired the trekkers to collect small garbage and IH time ensured that it is collected and segregated properly in base-camp.
2.The Trek leaders have the Idea of  'Servant leadership'. This was clearly evident from ,how our trek leader Dhaval organized himself and always keeping the team above than himself.
3.Food was awesome all through the Trek. Special attention was given to the quality. Thanks.

HI,
The trek went really well and we really had a great time. couple of small changes suggested
1 Your website mentions that BSNL and vodafone netwrok is there in sankri but thats not the case.Only BSNL netwrok comes that too between 4-6 am at some spots only. There is no signal after purola.
2 Your website says that Har ki dun trek is  easy flat walks with the fact that you have to walk 10 km daily on an average whereas there are regular ascents and every now and then. Would recommend to make this slight change to give the trekers a more realisitic perspective. 
The entire team of india hikes was really very warm and helpful throughout our trek and stay at sankri but my special words for the TL Krupa and the Guide Manu. They both were very nice and always smiling.
They belong to that class who enjoy their work.

Trek was good. Nice campsites, food, guides and TL.
Dinner tent was not there, so struggled a lot to have food.
Washing utensils in subzero temp and freezing water was a struggle
Couldnot sit outside the campsites in evening due to uneven terrain and dung. so chairs/stools would be good.
Very nice database in the website. 
Was very happy to see that you try to select different routes to and fro to give people a new experiecence even on their way bike. it shows your passion.
Also liked the fact that you give information about solo treks and also ask person to offload even when he has paid which shows the ethics and the organisation is not after money.
Good food. Nice Guide, cook and Trek leaders
It was nice to see oxygen cylinders and medicines being carried everywhere we went.
Good team execution.

Trek was amazingly organized. The food was upto the mark, local guides were very goog and trek leader ofcourse was very good. 
Every day's plan was very well chalked out. Loved the attention to health status, the predetermined menu for all the meals.
All through the trek I had a feeling of being in safe hands as well as a sense of being an equally responsible trekker.
Thank you for the amazing experience :)
 
Afreen was a great trek leader. Enjoyed her company all through. She got along with everyone comfortably with her easy go attitude, keenness for conversations with everyone about almost every topic :)
She helped the entire group gel very well with her games and icebreakers.
She had a very healthy balance between being joyous and fun loving as well as a responsible trek leader inciting discipline and responsibility in the group.
She connected with everyone by sharing her personal outlook and interest towards nature. The highlight for me which I shall carry all through would be the moment when she made us hug a tree. It was beautiful when no one questioned it and comfortably did what she said and I loved that moment thoroughly.
Kudos to Afreen! :)

After some serious trekking in the last six years I was searching for a high altitude trek in the snow. I researched and corresponded with a number of organisations. At 69 years of age and suffering with a few medical issues I wanted a company that took safety seriously and it was a paramount concern to that company.
After many corresponding emails I decided upon IndiaHikes.
I must say that from the very beginning, the trek leader and his team were absolutely fantastic.
At no stage during the trek did I feel uncomfortable, highly recommend.

Write from collecting the gaiters and micro-spikes from Lohajung to Asking all sort of useful and stupid questions to Deepak bhaiya and Gopal Bhiaya felt amazing. Deepak bhaiya's stories about rescues are too good and funny and lightens the mood of the whole trek.
And what to say about Mr.Dhaval Jajal, One awesome personality, You can call him the Captain cool of the trek. The calmest person on the trek , who got us back from the panic zone to comfort zone whenever we had headache or felt low or any discomfort. The activities he made us to play as part of the team build was just perfect for the team to feel as a family at the end of 3rd day.
Just in 3 days experienced whole lot of different world.

TREK WAS AWESOME!
Trek has completely brainwashed our thoughts, specifically Green Trail thing. Its being great journey from Day 1 to the Summit & down to base camp.
Before trek i have opted and paid for Backpack offloading but after reading mail of Prathima - where i got below note:
we don't usually encourage offloading of backpacks. These backpacks are carried by mules or porters. Having too many mules on a trail isn't good for the eco system and as for porters, they are hard to find.
 
So i thought lets try not to opts for & check my capability. i was shocked to find out that i have done trek easily without facing problem for once. so i am more confident for my fitness level & will keep improvising in daily exercise as well.
I have loved many thing on trek -  most and best thing was nature - Mountains, Stars at night, Snow, Sunset views, Sun rise, Trails etc
than we made many new friends on trek, learned many lessons while participating in activities was fun part.
Getting knowledge from Guides & TL was Helpful as well
 
Yeap i would give 10/10 for Safety standards. Trek was completely safe & we were in comfort zone - safety wise because of TL Dhaval Jhajal, Guide - Gopalji & Dipu bhai
Health checkup was done regularly by TL & guides use to warn us too for where to walk & where not to. 
Micro Spikes were very useful on our trek and also TL told us interesting story of how introduction of micro spikes stopped accidents on snow. Gaiters were also good, although we dint used much.

HI Team,
Very thankful for the trek that we just completed. It was fantastic experience and India Hikes team ensured that we become reach in our experience. Everything was 10/10 from day one to the last day. 
Our experience in pitching tents will be helpful for life time and in all my upcoming treks which I do in sahyadri range. All the instructions given by trek leader Anuj were helpful and he ensured that everything falls in place as per schedule. Trek leaders Baldev and Sunil were equally good and they support both fast pacers and slow movers like me. Everything was on time starting from morning tea, breakfast, Lunch & Dinner. I did not came across any delay on all the days. Pitching tents on ice was my first experience. When we decided that we have to sleep on tents pitched on ice, the thought going through mind was that our sleep is going to miserable, but our we got our best sleep on the ice pitched tents. It was wonderful. 
One thing which stands out is food. The Quality and Test. This is one of the reason that i did not loose any weight on this trek. I was expecting to loose at least 10 KG. But sadly not even a gram. Harpalji is awesome cook and my reason to go on multiple treks with you guys in future.

Best part of India Hikes is that they got us through the fresh trails while making to the summit. 
From the moment I reached Katgoan, i was skeptical as a beginner. But after meeting Leo Saldanha, Saini and Mukesh while the trek, things placed very well. The day of the summit was very tough. It was never-ending, at one point, I had almost given up with the negative thoughts that I had. But Mukesh, Leo and Saini motivated me and therefore, I could complete this trek. The moment I reach the summit, I cried like a baby.  The fact that trekkers who were little slow were placed first while trekking, which showed their priority of working at a team and keeping all together and completing the summit. I felt safe.  After completing, the descent was super fun, we played antakshari and we dint realized we were about to reach the base camp. We all wanted that this journey continues for days and days. Well, at last, heartfelt gratitude to all them, also those who cooked food for us, the persons carrying our bags and the entire team who contributed this trek for its success. 
The discipline and the safety was the utmost priority (Commendable) for  Leo Saldanha and so the whole group followed the instructions. This made the trek enjoyable. I loved the knowledge sessions and activities being played by Leo. The trek was an eye-opener for the fact that as an individual one can contribute to preserving the nature and so much for self-reflection.  The green trail initiative is good work. We all had this personal bond with each other at the end of the trek. Leo and his team will always remain an inspiration for us - the city people. It has taught us lessons and self-realization that cannot be put into words. This will remain long life with me.

The food which was provided was good and especially the Gulab Jamoon and Shahi tukda were mouth-watering. 
The safety standards followed was very good. Especially with fitness approval which we have to get a sign off from the trek co-ordinator and health checkups which are done on a daily basis. Fitness is a must for trekkers and is a checkpoint for each and every trekker on the trail which will avoid any serious implications on the trek. 
Renting the gear was a good part of the trek and it saved me a lot of money which I utilized for different purposes.
Green trails is a very good initiative which emphasizes not only carry our trash back but also cleaning the trail.

Mountains are humbling, teaches you lessons that are hard to forget.
For me the biggest lesson was, in life whatever seems high and achievable is going to be very difficult and so very worth of your efforts.
Living in the mountains taught me, how discipline brings more joy in real life.
This Kedarkantha trek was one of the most amazing experiences of my life. Absolutely loved it. While ascending, we had taken a different route through khujey and odari, which i guess not other trekking companies take. That was the best part, as we got to see different side of the mountain and a very clean side too. Food and other arrangements were very nice and timely.
A friend advised me to go with Indiahikes for safety reasons only, and boy he was all right! Safety was excellently taken care by the trek leader(LEO) from the condition of safety gears to health heck up at every camp-site thrice a day.
He used to give little dos and don'ts of the camp-site and while on the trek. That proved to be the best help. Overall, i guess safety is one of the values of indiahikes and that should be kept up !
I rented trek pole and waterproof socks. Waterproof socks are a blessing while trekking in snow. Highly recommended.
Our trek leader was simply amazing. He used to have small sessions before dinner which were the best part of the day. I really liked virtual volleyball and the snow-man making competition.

The safety maintained in the trek was excellent and due to the experience and cautious nature of the staff, we were able to complete the snow trek without any hiccups or accidents. The equipment provided such as gaiters and microspikes were of very good quality which ensured a smooth trek.
The Fitness regime suggested by IndiaHikes is very apt to enjoy the trek without any physical problems.

The trek was beyond beautiful - the trails, scenery, white forest was spectacular and gave me more that what i had expected. As a novice trekker, Kedarkantha was a perfect start for me and doing it with IndiaHikes just made the entire experience feel like a breeze. I would also like to highlight that the communication bit was very clear. Right from signing up, Manisha, our trek coordinator, ensured we have all the information we need so that we know what exactly to expect and come fully prepared.
When it came to safety, i was pleasantly surprised how much the team cared for every member in the team. Our trek leader, Dawa, and guides (Mangal ji & Ramesh ji) were very knowledgeable and were trained to handle all kinds of situation. Right from checking our pulse rate & oxy level to ensuring we have had the filling food and are feeling alright, they made us feel like a family. The taught us to trust the gears (gaitors & spikes)  which were of very good quality and helped us a lot with the ascent & descent.
I rented the trek pole, shoes, headlamp and my most favorite - the waterproof socks. The quality standard was high and mainly, the products were well maintained and clean. The socks helped me keep my feet safe from getting wet & cold.
Almost all the activities we did together was quite fun. Right from the introduction round & getting to know one another to playing Mafia in our common tent post snacks. My most favorite though, would be the last round table where we all had to share our experiences. It was quite emotional.
I'll just summarize the core points that stood out to me:
Sustainable trek experience
Great team of experienced and skillful trek leaders
Highly safe and top quality trekking gears and equipments
Mouthwatering food

The mountains teach us that whatever you achieve in your life, if you want to stand tall keep your feet on the ground no matter what you achieve.
Trek was awesome, couldn't have been better than this, the weather was with us also. The trek leader Dawa and the guides Rameshji and Mangal were like guardians for us over there, they took care of us. The foods were delicious as well as nutritious. The trail which India hikes took i.e. from Kotgaon to Khujey and then to Odari to Summit was really very beautiful.
The safety standards were excellent, from measuring blood pressure, pulse rate, to guiding us how to get through tough trails, safety standards were high. The trek leader and the guides ensured that we were safe throughout our trek. They even carried an oxygen cylinder in case of emergencies.
Indiahikes does force its trekkers to be fit before the trek begins and it is for the good of trekkers only, this is a great initiative by Indiahikes.
The Green Trails initiative is also a great initiative to keep the trails unpolluted and clean. Clean trails look really beautiful.

There is actually a lot to learn from the mountains and the trip teaches things almost at all steps.
To summarise
1. I felt like a minuscule in front of the might of nature. Teaches to be humble at all times.
2. The life in such weather is difficult. I thank the almighty for all what he has given me.
3. The most important thing such experience teaches is "" You get to know a lot about yourself"".
The trek was one of the best travel times I have ever spent. Thanks to the Indiahikes team, who were very professional, knew the details of all concerned things in-depth and caring at the same time. All 21 members of the trek reached the summit, due to the continuous encouragement and support from the leader and the support staff.
I rented the trekking poles. Obviously pocket-friendly and did not need to carry till the base camp.
Green trails shows the efforts of Indiahikes to create a clean environment in the trekking areas. No one wants to go trekking and find heaps of garbage from previous trekkers. While everyone keeps complaining about the lack of cleanliness in our country, it is so heartening to find you guys actually doing things for it. I took special care not to miss anything that I can carry back. Great initiative.

This trek was a great learning experience for me! it was a great experience to pitch and unpitch our tents! Outdoors can be a great learning experience for example when it was so cold outside we could see our kitchen staff working bare handed! Can't be grateful enough for the food that they provided. We had a small astronomy session on the campsite it really was very moving! It kind of put things in perspective that how small we are in front of the nature yet how we can make a huge impact. Last but not the least this was my 2nd trek with indiahikes, the leave no trails initiative is what sets IH apart! The 1st trek itself had a huge impact on me and made me a zero waste, responsible consumer! I could see everyone by the end of the trek actually discussing the issue of waste management and collecting waste from the trail. So yes this trek was a great learning experience!

I like how indiahikes stresses on preparation before the trek! Demanding screen shots is really an innovative idea to make sure everyone is physically and mentally prepared! Green trails is something that I have taken home with me from indiahikes. I have learnt it from here and imbibed it and now I practice it on Sahyadri treks as well! I truly believe in leaving the mountains in better condition than we found in and hence I carry a bag with me on every trek now to collect the garbage.

The mountain experience was a truly different experience. relaxing, rejuvenating, confidence builder and above all an eye-opener. Not only did it show that how things are taken for granted by us in our modern lives can be a challenge up there but also the importance of team spirit, helping each other and cohesiveness for survival in such difficult conditions in nature.
This was my first experience of a winter trek. it was definitely challenging but the exceptional organisational skills, knowledge of the things to come and the attitude of the entire India hikes team made it a smooth sail. I would say it could not have been better. stating it more objectively I would like to say
Safety and precision were never undermined. Experiencing the wilderness and nature in its purest form was always felt.

Few highlights:-
1. IH starts it's trek from Kotgaon and not from Sankri. From kotgaon to khujo the trails seemed just untouched by humans. So a thumbs up to IH for beginning trek from kotgaon and therefore keeping our morale high from the start.
2. The dedication of our guides Sanju Pawar, Prahalad Pawar, Aditya Pille. They were more than a guide to us. They took care of everything. They even carried bags of those who felt sick. Kudos to them.

The safety standards were good and just, regular health checkups were good to access the situation and also the safety gear and equipment given to us during the trek were good. Also the campsites were strategically placed in a safer and convenient environment which added to the safety benefit of the trekking group.
I rented out jacket, shoes and Trek poles which helped me financially.

Really looking forward to trekking again with you guys as soon as I manage holidays. It was really a memory which I will cherish for life because ""first time"" is always very special.
Every one of us should do something for the environment. Because it's only us who are polluting the environment. So we should try to clean it too for the coming generations and also to protect ecology. Salute to the India hikes members for putting so much effort into it.

3. Real growth is out of your comfort zone.

The trek was excellent. We were amongst the few lucky batches who were able to make it to the summit. The trek leaders and Trek guides were exceptional. 
 
The entire arrangement from IndiaHikes was perfect. 
 
Only one suggestion. I saw some of the fellow trekkers stopping on the trail to click pictures which would make everybody behind them wait too. It would be ideal if a trekker stands aside from the trail to click pictures so as to not block other trekkers. 
 
Safety standards are par excellence. I am a doctor by profession, and when I say the safety standards are really good, it actually means tht you people are really good.
 
I liked the part where the trek leader asked everyone to share their experience and what they learnt from the trek
 
I am impressed by your core values. The kind of importance that u people give to fitness is really good. Because it's to make the trek safer for a trekker. 
Green trails initiative also a great one. It imbibes a sense of responsibility towards nature in general which we can take back to the cities and continue to work towards.

I had taken up this trek because I wanted a break from my 9-6 routine, initially I had planned for this trek during Feb 19, but as we all know, vacation plans have 99% chances of getting cancelled and same did happen. However this time, was able to successfully achieve my vacation plan.
 
Kedharkantha and The Majestic Himalayas has taught me so much in this very short span of 6 days. Everything looks surreal, the views, the sheer beauty of mother nature. These things had once again taught and made me realize that how small are we as humans in this planet and how much more smaller are our problems.
At this altitude and rough terrain, i do believe that safety comes first and Safety standards of IH is impeccable, kudos to that.
I want to convey my heartfelt thanks to our Trek Leaders and guides - Adi , Meghna , Subash and Subash(Tony). They are the BEST, without them I don’t believe we would have had an memorable trek. These four are just AMAZING. 
The stringent fitness policy of IH, this needs a special mention here, it helped me to come out of my laziness and made me shed 13 kgs in 2 months. Without this trek, I would have never been bothered to hit the gym.

I learnt from the mountains:
1. How to appreciate life and just how blessed we are to be living among such luxuries.
2. How to stop worrying about trivial things and focus on the big picture.
3. How to find reasons to smile even when life may throw a few oddballs towards you.
 
It was nothing like I had expected and yet it surpassed everything that I did expect. No amount of words or pictures can be enough to prepare you for what you are about to experience in a trek like this. However, given how detailed all the planning and preparation by Indiahikes is, it practically is the best organization I've come across so far be it in terms of organizing or planning or food or even back up plans! There's absolutely nothing that I'd like to change.
I rented almost everything at the base camp and all the gears were in top notch quality.
Akshay is a brilliant trek leader. Right from the first intro and debriefing meeting to ending the trip with his famous mantra, he was so professional. The very first night he made us play an ice breaker activity at the Khujey camp site and we all became friends instantaneously.
He knows how to find the perfect balance between fun and discipline. So I really enjoyed trekking with him.
 
And not just him, both our guides OP bhaiya and Rajesh bhaiya were always making sure that we had smiles on our faces no matter how difficult things may get, encouraging us, pushing us and even chiding us when needed but never giving up on us. So kudos to all three of them for making sure our experience was amazing.
This is the one thing that I truly appreciated while trekking with Indiahikes. You don't just preach about the importance of preserving nature, you actually make sure that you walk the talk and also encourage everyone else to do so.

No matter how difficult things get push yourself harder and you'll make it no matter what. Just keep up your spirit high and your goals and destination firm... In the all that matters is if you succeeded or you gave up... If you succeed with the efforts and look back you'll be stronger than you were and hungry for more.
We made it to the summit... Our trek was really challenging and wonderful... everything was taken care by our trek leaders they really are a wonderful bunch who made everything possible. A memorable experience to the everyone's dairy...
Few of the challenges we faced were:
Harsh weather conditions.
Opening up new paths.
And upon all of these the whole team trekked together in all conditions that's the best part…
Safety were really another criteria that needs to be credited because that's a critical things to keep a check with and the India hikes team tries to get it on track right from the very beginning i.e. from the day we enroll ourselves on the trek until the very end of the journey wen we bid good bye with a heavy heart on the final day. Checking up the heart rate and bp timely and doing the safety measures in all the required possible ways.
So cheers to such a well organised safe trek being carried out.
There were a lot of activites carried out by the trek leader but the most enjoyed and wonderful of them all personally for me was being the sweeper trek leader that was assigned to me seeing the way i was active and more energetic in the trek which i really carried out well and got rewarded as the spirit of the trek. And other was adding an adjective to our names initially to introduce ourselves and the subsequent person had to remember and call out all the names of the preceding ppl and then introduce himself which really got the bonding among the team from the very initial moment of the trek.
Green trails... It's really a very great initiative being taken by the India hikes team to ensure that the nature isn't harmed by their exploring of the nature in its trek... rather keep the path and surrounding around India hikes team maintain the nature the way it is and enjoy the trek.
And regarding fitness it has only one main motive to either gather up your guts and get them harder and fit to make it on top of summit else stay lazy and unfit sand miss out the best amazing experience of your life.

The most important lesson which I learnt while on the trek was that we are always stronger than we think we are. It is just because of our comfort zones that we restrict ourselves. Once we let go of the comfort zone then the world is ours to conquer.
This trek has really made me realise the value of fitness in our lives. It is of paramount importance to be physically fit. It was really a good move to make the trekkers submit fitness proofs covering a certain distance in the stipulated given time.
To trek with IndiaHikes has been by far one of the best decisions I've ever made in my life. The employees literally put their heart and soul into their jobs. It can be clearly seen that it isn't a job for them but something they are passionate about. Kudos to the cooking staff for never making us feel like we're far away from our homes. 
The safety standards were excellent. Cut offs were clearly mentioned and were adhered to.

The Trek was very well arranged, very well co-ordinated, great locations for campsites, great tents and facilities provided at campsites, great food. Every thing was exceptionally great. Safety is the topmost priority for every trekker and this is been very well followed by India Hikes.
Special thanks to our Trek Leader Pradyumna, Prathima, Krithika, Bhagat Singh ji, Yashpalji... and to all at the backend team of India Hikes who made it so easy for all of us.

 
Renting makes it very easy for managing your budget and also reduce consumption. Yes, I had rented gear like Shoes, Jacket and WaterProof Socks. The items are really well maintained.
I would recommend trekkers to rent all the available gears instead of buying. This makes your trips in budget and reusing the products reduce in consumption and wastage foot print.
I would like to specially talk about WaterProof socks that i had rented and are really worth renting and using them. Snow treks make it difficult using general socks as they get wet even though you use good shoes, This leed to frostbites and take a long time to cure and cause sever infection which may go worse after your trek. These Sock are so good that though you feel little cold they do not get wet from inside. And most importantly these are breathable and you really feel comfortable while wearing them.
Will give a 10/10 score to the waterproof socks and thanks to Indiahikes for introducing them in your rental products.
Also the rental pricing for all the products are at minimal and worth. 
So Happy Renting....

There are many things that I have learnt from the 4-5 days that I have spent for the mountains
1. Respect for time
2. Discipline
3. Appreciate what we have, there are bigger problems to solve than what we think we experience
4. Always respect the Mountain Gods and the Nature and never let yourself be bigger than the weather conditions
5. Life can be lived in a very basic and a simple manner and we do not need our fancy gizmos all the time.
6. Always be humble and kind and helping to other people.
The trek was fantastic, more than I had imagined. This was by far the most amazing trek experience that I had.
I had rented Shoes, Jacket and Trekking Pole which were great and these gears made my life a little easy in the mountains. Also I think renting gears is a great initiative that IndiaHikes has taken as it also helps trekkers to pack light.
Our trekker Vivek Saini, kept us motivated the entire duration of the trek. He shared some amazing stories of the campsite and also told some of his own trekking experience which was great.
I think IndiaHikes apart from running treks, they also ensure that they have impacted a persons life in a positive way even if it is for the smallest bit.
GreenTrails initiative is great in addressing environmental issues and with that bringing in self awareness in trekkers.

Day1 - what a mesmerizing view of moon from Kotgaon with snow all around.
Day2 - way to Khujjey - a very long journey of 6 hour ascending but worth the walk. Amazing experience. Amazing guide and team leader Aditya. The war cry at the start of the trek was something to always remember. Ookh Alaila!!!
Day3 - Way to Odari - quite simpler then day 2 ascending. Reached in 4 hours. Amazing breathtaking view.
Day4-amazing walk to Summit. We tried our best
Day5 - Happiest day to descend to see our home. Thanks to the guide to make the trail for us.
Overall - Management was amazing. Right from TL to guide to cooking staff - salute to them. Speechless food. Sweet at the end of the day was something to always wait for. 
Indiahikes is extremely safe in terms of health, Trek gears, trail, etc

This trek boosted my confidence a lot and showed the value of discipline in life and how lucky we are to have all these luxuries in life which in day day to life are taken for granted. Before taking this trek im not sure about my strength to complete the trek but after doing the summit i experienced the peace and happiness both in the journey and reaching the summit. This trek is my lifelong beautiful memory and thank you for making this trek this awesome.Tthe trek is quite comfortable I think all the basic amenities possible are provides thank you so much for keeping us safe.

All the health checkups from time to time are done without fail to ensure maximum fitness to everyone thanks to that. Overall i loved the trek and how it is organized im looking forward to complete all the treks in Indiahikes.
The warmups before and after the trek are good and actually cool us down after a day long trek. Our trek leader Drishyant make sure we are safe from cramps or body pains after the trek. The warmup session before the trek is very good and it kept us going. we had so much fun in dinner tents by sharing stories of everyone and really enjoyed a lot
I thought indiahikes is just another trek company and i just book this trek just by asking question on quora. so I was a little skeptical about the trek and Indiahikes.

Now I am more confident than ever, On top you've got lot of time with just yourself, and you wonder how peaceful the nights were. I am over whelmed by walking in woods and snow.

There is so much that mountains offered me but two big things were patience and resilience. Taking caution with each step, listening to your body, and continue to move, even when you are tired and you feel your bag is too heavy, you can't take another step.  
The other thing the mountains gave me were ample opportunities to marvel at the beauty around me and thus hope.
I loved the trek and these were some of the things that made it so great:
Our Trek Leader, Dushyant, was amazing! He was supportive, kind and firm when he needed to be.
The campsites were beautiful and the kitchen teams and our guides did whatever they could to make it comfortable for us.
The food exceeded my expectations. I loved how warmly they offered it to us and how delicious it was!
I really enjoyed people around me who came with us on the trek.  I have definitely made a couple of friends for life!
The sleeping bags and Dushyant's tips helped me keep myself warm even with all the snow around me.
The stress on safety protocols and routines such as filling up health cards assured me I was in good hands.
All the gears we rented were useful to us. We were slightly disappointed because we rented a pair of trekking poles but only received one- the reason was communicated and I understand but perhaps it can be avoided in the future treks.
Sustainability, Care, Transparency
I loved all the efforts India Hikes have put in making our treks green- from the concept of Eco Bags, the dry toilets to 3 Sink Washing System to re-using flex posters to use it as charts in the base camp. It shows great respect for nature and local people.

Mountains taught me many things. They helped me in making some good friends. Mountains taught me to live in minimum resources and there is a life beyond city.
The trek was awesome and you guys were a great support to me. Before starting the trek I give a thought as it was looking quite impossible to me but people around me kept motivated me.
You guys have a very good safety standard. Your daily health check-up helped a lot.
Green trails is a very good idea followed by indiahikes. It taught me to keep aur surrounding clean and green and our mountains are very important part of our economy.

The main factor that drew me to the mountains is how humongous and majestic they are. Everyone are felt and treated equal without differences in mountains. It tells you no matter how sound you are finally or by social status, you are as tiny as you can get in presence of these giant mountains.
My personal takeaway is that, you can push your physical limits and achieve things if you are mentally strong, even harsh environmental factors doesn't bother if the goal is so clear and mind is so strong.
This is my first high altitude trek and it turned out to be so special because I thoroughly enjoyed every moment of it. We were presented with snowfall in nayata campsite after our summit decent. It was a first snow encounter for many of us in the team and we had very good fun playing around in snow.
Not only that, the whole of our trek group was so vibrant and sportive to an extent that we used to play many team building games after reaching every campsite. This added as positive factor for the overall trek.
Absolutely fantastic safety standards. This being my first solo trip my husband had huge concern on my safety and after reading so many reviews about female solo travelers with Indiahikes, he was convinced to certain extent and let me do the booking.
After reaching the base camp, I was presented with the safety routines - oxymeter, health checkups and documenting the readings and also the safety gears - micro spikes, gaters etc. The safety measurements are very much satisfactory and added confidence to me that I can finish the trek in sound health.
We played several team building games and activities conducted by our trek leader at campsites and all of them were very lively. Right from our morning stretches, to massages after a tiring trek day to playing Mafia, it was fun filled. I had rented out outer jacket, trek pole and shoes. The gears were all well maintained and in good condition.
Green trails initiative is something so personal to me because it was aligned with my principles in reducing usage of single use plastics.
We were happy to contribute a bit to mountains by collecting possible wastes from our trails in the eco bags and segregating them after reaching the base camp.

Being from Chennai, my winters hover around 24°C and that is cold enough to make me shiver. For me to trek and live for a week in Sub-Zero temperature is an achievement in itself. I have had to handle myself, physically and emotionally. Often in the cities, I have my family, friends to take care of me in one way or the other. But during the trek, the only support system for me was myself and I quite liked it.
The trek let me explore a proper winter trek, the views were astonishing and it was as if we camped in winter wonderland.
The camp sites and food served were top notch! Loved every moment.!
Safety is a word one often hears when trekking with Indiahikes! So yes, I always felt safe during the trek.
The oxymeter was unable to fetch the correct information at times though, that is something you can work on.
I rented a pair of trek poles and they were pretty useful. Greentrails is a great initiative

The mountains make you realize how small a part you form of this world. Trekking in the mountains has always been a very grounding experience for me, and I enjoy the entire transformation of my emotions right from the base till the summit. It is not just about reaching the top, but the entire journey and what it does to your body and spirit. And the bonds you form on mountains, the hardships you face, the kindness you give and get in return, is something very unique and cannot be found in city lives.

This was my first trek ever. And i have a lot to take back with me. This trek has taken a lot of effort to reach at the top and then given me a beautiful memory which is going to be with me forever.
I have learnt that no matter how big the obstacles stand in front of you, with little bit of courage and strength you can climb the tallest mountain that comes before you.
The trek was beyond my expectations . Right from the management by India Hikes , to food , to time management. Each and every aspect was commendable.
Our trek leader Himanshu Singla was one of the best person i have come across. He is a humble human being who is very much passionate about trekking and more importantly encouraging his trekkers in completing the trek and most importantly enjoying it all through. His team building activities in the evening have made us come close together as a group .
Green trails by india hikes are one of the best practices by India Hikes. Also having an eco bag to collect waste left on the mountains and leaving the mountains better is a very encouraging value we have followed throughout our trek

As we all know nature is the best teacher. Mountains have taught me a lot. We should be like the mountains, in life. Calm, Strong from the roots, withstanding the hurdles in life, like mountains stand against the breeze. We should be the symbol of positivity like how mountains fill positivity in the heart of the people trekking when they approach them.
One can see solutions to all their life problems just by staring at mountains and thinking with right wisdom.
It was really amazing. Weather had supported us in a great way to see all aspects of  mountains & nature throughout the trekking. 
I would like to thank IH for making the trek look so easy by providing the right kind of food and shelter. IH has provided an indirect opportunity to meet like minded people. 
I absolutely agree with the safety measures taken by IH. Working on the toilet system to make it more hygienic would be of great help. I dont know like how we can make it. One more thing would be, if IH can provide hot water after trek, so that people will clean up themselves and relax.
Renting of gears is a nice idea IH has come up with. It helps both people and environment by saving money and extra production of goods that affect nature. Gears are in proper usage state.
Green trails is an amazing  and a minimum thing that we can do to mountains those have provided us with immense happiness. Like squirrels help.
 IH actually prepares everybody for the trek with their fitness requirement and make the trek successful.

It was a must needed break for me from my professional and personal life and I introduced myself to my limits, endurance, and respect towards nature. 
A life-changing experience for me and I will remember those 6 days throughout my life.
What I liked:
- Local guides were very much active and helpful.
- Well organized trekking experience.
- Regular Oximeter test: 5 stars
- Trekking poles: 5 stars (Recommended for all)
- Trekking shoes: 4 stars (Recommended for all)
Improvements/changes:
- Need experienced trek leaders.
- The campsites could be more hygienic and clean. 
- Food variety could be changed.
- Trekkers are not enjoying their trekking.
- Facilities could be increased in basecamp (Hotwater etc.) 
- Mostly, fun and enjoyment were very less.
- Down Jacket: 3 stars (Need to work on cleanliness & build quality of jacket) 
- Hand gloves: 3 stars (Need more thicked gloves for winter trek)
Fitness is the best part of IH as it demands fitness proof (5Km in 30 mins) which helped a lot for us. Green Trails seems very poor on hillsides and its because trekkers are very busy and tied with trekking itself. We need to deploy a separate team for this. 
The overall experience was very good.! :-)
Thank you, IH. :-)

Dayara Bugyal is my 3rd trek with Indiahikes. Everytime I come to Himalayas, it teaches me something new. Sometimes it's patience, sometimes it's being organized, taking care of your health and being happy with as little as you have!
This was my first snow trek (though I have done Sandakphu in winter before but it had no snow at all!). I always complement Indiahikes for being so well organized starting from trek leader's briefing, food, taking care of the team, etc! Himanshu is very mature for his age and handled every situation perfectly! At freezing -12 temperatures he motivated for all of us to keep going and making this a successful summit! We celebrated New year's day on the summit and it was a dream come true!
Safety in Indiahikes is 100% and this is why all my Himalayan treks have with with you and will continue to do so!.
Rented a poncho and a waterproof pair of gloves. Never had the need to wear the Poncho as it did not snow during the trek. Gloves were very clean and of best quality with no wear and tear of any kind.
Green trails is an integral part of Indiahikes and kiddos for it!! No carbon footprint is very necessary to keep our mountains and environment clean and I have been a part of it each time I am in the mountains regardless of I am trekking or traveling.

* Diversity & Inclusion - There is no status nor divide when it comes to the mountains, all are equal and yet unique 
* Teamwork & Passion - Together we stand tall and divided we can fail. If you have the love for something, you can go for the highest pinnacle without a doubt!
* Self-Belief & Self-love - The mountains are the only place that teaches a person the true aspect of love and belief for oneself. I have never felt so much of love for myself and the belief I have had for my life. Truly giving me total ""Unborness"" for years to come

One of the best things i learned from this trek is ""RANGER ROLL"". Its such a cool thing and will go long way in changing few things in my life. Its so small thing yet it impacts our packing in a huge way.
 never expected trekking can be so fun. Right from our safety to food to camp sites to fun activities and all the sessions of instructions. India Hikes, you people are awesome!! Special thanks to Trek leader, Mr. Singla and trek guides for making our 5 days so fun that it was hard for us to return back to normal lives.he instructions on Trekking, Gears, Safety, etc, we received from them was in so detail that novice trekkers like me didn't have a single doubt remaining in our mind. A BIG thank you to Kitchen staff at each camp site for diligently working in cold hours for making delicious food for us. I never imagined in my life that i will  be getting desserts in evening in such harsh weather conditions and that too on treks. One of the best part that i will remember my entire life will be the quality of food we got at each campsites.
The Health card thing was awesome. Taking Oxygen & BP level reading for each participant twice a day could give more insight to trek leader on health condition  of participants. Also trek leader Mr. Singla left no stone unturned to ensure safety of each one of us. Asking each one of us twice a day on how we feel might be a simple gesture but we felt really good that yeah we are in safe hands.
It is a really great idea where each one us could actually contribute towards environment by collecting waste articles on our trek into our ECO BAGS!! The speed at which these mountains are getting polluted, initiatives like this help in preserving nature in a big way.

As a first time trekker, I had an amazing experience. I'm falling short of words to explain my trek. We could see the Chandrashila peak right from the sari base camp. Day 1 from sari to Deoria-Tal was a mild trek, and a stop at rohini bugyal should us almost the whole route we were about to take in the next 3 days. The sunset at Deoria-Tal blew my mind away. The continuous change in the colour of the mountains was just wow. The next day, the first half went easy with gradual ascent and descent, but the 2nd half was the steep descent to syalmi which drained all the energy I had. But the reward was the view of Milkyway galaxy in the clear sky after sunset. Thanks to team Indiahikes on YouTube and on emails, I used 2 trekking poles which were my lifesaver. I can't thank you enough for that suggestion. The next day, route to baniyakund was a steep ascent but I didn't have any problem thanks to the beautiful jungle we passed through.. after relaxing for a bit, we made snowman near or tent and enjoyed. That night was terrific due to the extreme temperatures ever faced. Thanks to Raju Da who trained us to use the microspikes and also boosted our confidence for the next day's summit push. He was very strict regarding the time management and discipline, that we were at the spot 15mins before the stipulated time even in that cold weather.  I literally can't say in words how good the summit climb experience was. Specially after crossing tungnath, I was in the front and was my excitement was at its peak. There were 3 or 4 places where we were redirected to a new route to avoid steep hill climb and take a zigzag pattern, where I literally sank in the snow till my waist.. I just LOVED that experience. Our team was very quick to reach the summit and had 1 full hour to spend on the peak. As soon as I reached the peak, I got so emotional that I cried for 5 mins.  I couldn't believe that ""I"" made it till there. The view from up there.............................. I don't know what to say. What else do you want to see other than this in your life.. I don't think there is anything better than that in the whole world. I just realized that I wrote so much. I just re-lived the whole trek writing this that I couldn't stop.

I can write about the whole experience in a word, in a sentence, in a paragraph, as an essay.
Awesome!
The trek was planned to the last tee. The pace of the trek, the graded increase in altitude, the campsite facilities everything was well planned. What was more amazing is the team that IH has.
It started out with wanting to ""conquer"" the heights. It was only a couple of weeks before our trek that Brahmatal witnessed immense snow that a few of the earlier groups could not make it to the summit. Snow was predicted for the 1st of January and it could have been anybody's guess how the weather will play out. We were in for a delight when we had good weather all through the trek that we could reach the summit and were treated to a snow fall on the day we left Lohajung. The trek ended with a great sense of gratitude for having been bestowed such an experience and with the sense of wanting to conquer subdued. The mountains have a lovely way of inculcating humility. Hospitality at every campsite at those heights and God forbid weather was impeccable. The quality of food is not mentioned. Hot, tasty, healthy food with good variety ensured that not one of us lost weight despite climbing 12,250 ft.
We got to see trekkers from other trekking companies in some camp sites and on the way to the summit. They played loud music, some smoked, and a few were loud and disturbing the tranquility of the place. I realized the effect of your communication strategy about responsible trekking right from the first mail that you send. 
IH trekkers stood apart as responsible wanting the leave the place at least as pristine as it is if not better. The eco bag that all of us carried was a constant reminder about our responsibility, lest we get carried away.
The stories and experiences that Pradyumna and Kundan Chacha shared over the 4-day trek were amazing and entertaining.

Safely standards are high and great I believe. Although coming to hygiene, usage of the same water for cleaning of tiffins by the trekkers was not hygienic as the same water after repeated usage became dirty with everyone's waste food. Saving water is okay, but for that trekkers can be given a fixed amount of water for each wash. 
Also, The toilets in baniyakund can have some light arrangements as even with our headlamps, it was difficult to locate them at night as they were sort of far from the tents and one can slip or get injured when going alone for the toilet.

The stillness, yet the strength of the mountains is unbelievable. As I reached the summit, all the effort and tough times I went through while climbing was just forgotten. Living around nature is like you have entered a whole new world, the snow glittering in the moonlight and then shining in the sunlight adds on to the experience all together. I definitely take some wonderful memories back home from my first himalayan trek and it wasn't only the mountains that I learnt from but also the people who joined along, everyone being so humble and supportive.
At the first trek, we got certificates during debriefing, that have now become online. I like that special feeling of receiving certificates on the spot.

I loved everything about trek. Only thing which I didn’t like is the way we started from Dehradun. It should be more coordinated. Otherwise one of the best experience of my life.
Yes, I rented backpack and trek pole. Both were in good condition and worth renting.

Lessons I take back from the mountains
- It is good to slow down
- It is good to ask for help
- It is good to not have to win - coz the mountains are going to be there regardless.
This is my first ever serious trek and I absolutely loved. 12 days have gone by since the trek ended and I can still see the path we took, the scenes we saw, the laughter we shared and the peace I felt.
First and foremost - our team from India hikes - Dhaval sir was amazing.. gentle  soul and yet so strict when required.. he brought all of us together, gently nudging us in the right direction, encouraging us, telling us stories about the treks and the mountains and yet partaking in our fun and frolic in equal measure.  Dhaval sir was truly inspiring.
I have not felt safer...regular monitoring and Dhaval Sir made it so easy for us to go upto him and tell him if we are feeling unwell.
Rented the trekking poles - wont have made it even half was through without it and the Microspikes provided to us were true life savers!
Post debrief session, we were taught about segregating waste and what happens to each of it.  It was a true eye opener - 90 percent of what we collected was landfill. That is really scary and I am already trying to reduce my usage of plastic wrapped things to the extent possible

Loved every part of it. From the way emails made it more easy for me to do the trek, creating the whatsapp group to know my fellow trek-mates, green trails initiative, camping locations, awareness of guides and trek leaders about the trek, food and what not.
I feel so happy for choosing India Hikes.
I found all my trek-mates having a good fitness level. None of us was lagging behind.
The trail was so neat that it was very hard for us to get something to put in our eco-bags. I wish all other trekking groups adopt some similar initiatives.

I learnt a few things from the trek. Fatigue is the state of mind - with proper motivation, it can be averted
If the team is professional and creates comfort zone to each individual, summit will be an enjoyable experience.
I could see that each and every employee followed the core values. There was uniformity in communication across all levels.
The importance of fitness was well established and helped us throughout the journey with minimal injuries and illness.
Green Trails was an innovative way to give it back to the society which I believe will alter our purchasing habits once we are back to the cities

The biggest lesson I'm taking back from this trek is about managing time and learning it for the nature! The nature is never late or doesn't miss on anything thing. The sun will rise on time and the stars will twinkle on time! And so we must stick to out schedule and respect it too.
There is no doubt that this was the best trip I've ever had! Bout not only the trek was so beautiful but even our trek leader Pranav was the sweetest person I've met so far. He was so cooperative and always available to answer the silliest possible question that one wants to ask. Besides being such a sweetheart he was so positive and motivating. I wouldn't have reached the summit if it wasn't for him. There was no doubt  he had that even one of us will not be able to make it and there we were.. all 19 of us could reach the peak! He has answered all the questions with such patience  and have been smiling all the time.
Also I had the best batch I could ask for. There were these amazing people who were selfless and helping each other even beyond there reach.
The supporting staff and the kitchen staff are irreplaceable in true words.
I just didn't want to go back home. And I'm so sure of coming back sooner! The safety and the facilities were flawless!
Not only the trek leader took all the efforts of making sure of our health but he also took a step ahead in explaining different conditions to us and making sure that we're all self-sufficient if needed. The very idea of having these health checkups have blown my mind and has made me feed so safe even before taking these oximeter readings I was sure that I'll be fine even if the readings were out of the range.
There was absolute no negligence when it came to health and safety of each one of us!
It's amazing how Indiahikes is taking all these efforts towards sustainable development and encouraging recycling too!
This was one of the finest experience and I know I speak for everyone when I say this.
We will do our bit to ensure that we leave the mountains better than we found them!

Sustainability is one of of the major lesson I take back from the trek. I loved the trek. I has the best team and trekkers. Food , tents equipments everything was amazing.
Yes safety standards were very good and infact the guides were amazing too, as they helped us a every bit of the trek.
Renting the gears is good option as it is afforded at very economical price. It's a very good move of green trails. I truly believe that we should experience the nature at its best and to do that we also need to keep it clean which is very much understood by India Hikes.

I loved the mountains and the challenges imposed by the low temprature was very enjoyable.
The trek was nice but a little underwhelming. I would have liked more of a challenge, fewer rest stops and repeatedly waiting for everyone to catch up. It was difficult to build a rythmn. It would also be nice if the group would stick to timings a bit more (the role of trek leader could be key here) since packing, getting ready and then waiting for others to get ready when it's so cold is really not pleasant.
As for fitness, multiple people on the trek mentioned that they sent wrong screenshots/ se screenshot for multiple people. There was less than random overlap between such people and those lagging behind. I may be being a  bit harsh here, it was an easy/beginners trek, but since everyone in the group goes as fast as the slowest person, I think IH ought to be a bit more stringent on following up with the fitness requirements it prescribes (less emails, more thorough checking of submitted info).
Safety standards were overall good. One key space for improvement- on the summit day we were supposed to use our crampons till we reached the base camp that evening. However, we were asked to take them off when we reached the camp where our stuff was since the next batch needed them. No one was hurt but there were a lot of slips on the walk from that camp down to the next campsite,which could have been avoided with better infrastructure/ coordination by IH.

Brahmataal trek for me personally was very life-changing. I did the trek with a group of 4 of my childhood friends, which turned out to be the best vacation for us. 
Things which I learned from the trek:
1. Life is all about living the moments.
2. If you are determined enough you can achieve any heights in life no matter what.
3. Things will always go wrong in some shape or form, keep your focus on the goal.
4. Right Mentors and Right Friends in life are very crucial for your success.
 The trek was full of ups and downs and it turned out to be very beautiful experience for me.

Things I learnt from the trek
1. Minimalist approach to life
2. Its more about psychological strength than physical strength you require.
3. Would always remember this trek as this was my first ever trek!
Absolutely, I loved the trek to the core. And if i have to say some changes than it would be as below:
1. Provide lukewarm water to wash utensils. Its very difficult to wash utensils with such freezing water in minus degree temperatures.
2. Try to make the camp environment more light. I felt that it was more of a professional approach at the cost of fun.
3. Making inventory management more effective. We had to give away micro spikes at the time of descending at chilapada campsite so that the next batch can utilise that. And that made our descending difficult. Almost half of us fell while descending atleast 5-6 times. Fortunately no one got injured.
One of the best service provided by you is renting a gear. We made most of it by renting everything we could and that saved us atleast 3-4 thousands. :)
Fitness test really helped me personally for the trek. Also its helping me after my trek.
Green trails is an appreciable initiative towards sustainable environment.

The approach of keeping the mountains clean and green inspired me. I'd definitely follow it.
The trek was really great for its picturesque, snow covered trail and snow-white peaks in clear blue sky. We had excellent trek leader and guides. Trek leader took care of everyone from the very beginning to until we reach to final camp. Guides had good knowledge of the trails and they are quite efficient. They are aware of the feelings of local people and told us about the myths and stories that made our journey more enjoyable.
I'd request Indiahikes to provide more nutritious food during the trek. It was a winter trek and would be better if supply of lukewarm drinking water could increased. One small request from this trekker, like the summit day can you provide some dry fruits everyday while we walk through the trails.
IH follows good standard of trekker safety. Everyday we had a health check up and trek leader took care of everything. On summit day IH provided microspikes to ease our trek on the ice and snow. To climb to the peak trek guide made our path using a rope and he guided everyone to reach to the top through the slippery path.
Trekker's safety and clean and green approach must be appriciated.

The trek makes us realise we are nothing in front of the mountains. Proper precautions should always be taken in any trek. 
One thing I take away is that the mountains made us stay away from our comfort zones and experience wilderness. We shouldn't take anything for granted. It was a tough (out of comfort zone) but wonderful experience. I got to experience the phrase, the best view from the hardest climb.

On the day we had to trek to Chandrshila summit, we started to trek at 5:40 AM from Chopta and kept on walking in snow covered in the dark because we knew that if we want to summit Chandrashila peak, we just have to walk and think about nothing else.

After living amidst the luxuries of the city, the mountains teach you how to compromise.
They also taught me to help and trust like the mountain people. Kundan chacha worked tirelessly throughout the day, guiding us through the trail and serving us food. Even when we were resting at Khururai after the descent, he set off cutting firewood so that we could enjoy a little heat from the fire. The mountain people are truly the best. 
I think I'll come back again and again. The journey was demanding as well as rewarding. Felt like giving up a few times, but the encouragement and support provided by Tina and the amazing team got me through.

I would like to thank India Hikes for making my first winter trek so wonderful. It has set pretty high standards for the treks to follow. Right from the guidelines provided before the trek to the food on the trek, from the trek guides to ye all new campsite (Telandi was surreal, I recommend you to keep this campsite in the itinerary) everything was perfect. 
Few things to share from the trek -
1. Do the small things right - like on the trek it was important take care of ourself, eat properly, wear proper gear, abide by guidance provided by experts. When we are trying to achieve something big, it’s very necessary to make sure that we take care of the smaller things which eventually make up the 
bigger picture.
2. Identify your strengths and weaknesses and consequently divide your goal into smaller milestones as per your capability. Like on the trek, the journey to the summit was split into several days so that we could have enough rest along the way and not exhaust ourselves.
3. The destination is most exciting, but the journey is more important than the destination.
4. Most importantly, somewhere on our journey we shouldn’t forget to look back and enjoy the view. Be proud of what you’ve achieved and take inspiration from those achievements to reach greater heights.

There was no problem throughout the trek, leader Braham kept all of us busy at camping sites and added knowledge about trekking gears and equipment, food and stay arrangement was good at all camping locations, transport to and fro was upto the mark!
Finally weather always plays important roll in the successful trek, and our batch was quite lucky to get good weather for all days.
On the other side three people per tent is still not acceptable to me, many times I informed about the inconveniance caused, but it was not agreed to till date by IH and explained always by giving some reason for that! Please this to be considered.
Various games played during stay at camp sites and the information given about trekking gears and equipments was the most appreciable!.
It is nice IH is always involved in keeping the trail clean and green by arranging Green Trails and inculcating habit in trekkers to keep mountain environment as is - at its own beauty!

I loved this trek cause the sites were beautiful, people were great and the trek lead did a great job integrating all of us in well.
One thing I would like to suggest is the trek preparation regime (body fitness regime) provided by indiahikes is extremely inadequate. I followed that for my trek before this and I struggled throughout the trek. However for this trek, I followed this regime and it worked wonders for my endurance. If I was still smiling at the sumit, it’s because of this. I would highly encourage this (or some regime similar to this) be recommended to first time trekkers to help prepare them better for mountains.
The safety standards set up are good. It was very good that our trek lead followed it to the dot. This level of implementation was missing in my last trek and I hope every trek lead implements this as Braham.

Patience is key when it comes to trekking in mountains. Be patient and you will be rewarded at the end of the day.
I loved the trek. The trek leader Braham made the experience memorable. We were well taken care of by our guides Robin and Devaraj. The trek group was very accommodating/friendly. Below are some of the improvements that i would suggest to improve our experience. i suggested the same to the trek leader on our last day
1) The group needs to be educated on tent etiquette on day 1 For ex: How to maximum space within a tent ( just as an example, The trekking bags should be placed outside the tent at the back door and not inside the tent)
2) For people who are elder, squatting in compost pits is a huge problem. There needs to be some sort of portable potty chair or something that will make it easier for them. we had young children as well as one senior (age 67) in the group struggling with the compost pits. the compost pits are the only reason they hesitate to do more treks. One of the senior person in the group was hesitating to eat any food because they didn't want to use compost pits in the morning.
3) Sleep is very essential for a good trekking experience. All the sleeping bags are not of the same quality. For two days, i got sleeping bags which were very crampy, especially near the feet. This makes us feel suffocated. But on the third day, i got a sleeping bag(model is alaska 400 ...) which was very good/spacious. This sleeping didn't make me feel suffocated at all. All the sleeping bags should be of the same quality. If not, on day 1, people should be told to reach out to trek leader in case their sleeping bag isn't the right fit. i assume there will be some spare ones.
4) 3 people per tent is sometimes an issue. I understand from the trek leader why 3 people per tent makes sense. i agree with most of the reasons. Maybe we should have slightly bigger tents. It gets a little too stuffy sometimes.
All safety protocols were followed and i always felt safe throughout the duration of the trek.
The games in the dinner tent every night were fun. The entire team got to know each other well.
Very impressed overall. i am looking forward to my next trek with india hikes. I hope some of the feedback i have given is considered. My expectations with India hikes is very high after this trek.

Not to crib about things, to live a simple life is the most important lesson Iearnt from the mountains.
The trek was awesome, the cold temperatures was making the experience a little bit difficult but i enjoyed the trek throughout.
Yes, i rented shoes and trek pole. Unfortunately i couldn't rent ponchos as the stock was over. One thing India Hikes could do is send an email to people who booked the trek and ask in the email as in how many people want to rent the things, in that way they will get to know the exact idea on how many people want to rent and can keep the stock ready.
The way Indiahikes sticks to their core values is impressive. IH Greentrails is one of the best thing happened to Indiahikes, this is the best way to keep our mountains clean.

The best thing of 2019 is those 6 days.
Such a process oriented organisation the logistics, food.. it takes too much of co-ordination and involvement to do things. And IH does it.  Hot water facility at all campsites would be appreciated.

Huge shout out to our trek leaders and the guides who trusted us to make it further towards the goal and in return, we pushed ahead and made everyone proud.
Highly professional on the safety front, I must say. This was my first time with IndiaHikes and I must say such protocols are better than asking a trekker whether they are feeling better or not. Especially in case of health check-ups, numbers speak for themselves and help reduce risks.
one key lesson: no matter what the setbacks, challenge them, overcome them and come out an achiever.

Absolutely amazing trek mostly thanks to our trek leader.
I am not easily moved. In fact, though I appear outwardly social, I consider myself to be quite skeptical of new people and experiences. However, this note isn't about me. 
This note is about the absolutely spectacular experience I had trekking with Avijit Jamlokhi, our trek leader on the Deoriatal-Chandrashila trek batch of 22nd December. 
Education: Our education started from Day 0. While we were briefed about the trek the night before, Avijit covered all aspects of how to pack our bags, how to wear our shoes and how to interact with each other. Not only did he cover each aspect in specific detail, but he also told us why each point is important and how each of those enhances our experience while trekking. This education got better each day and we were in awe of how much of information he held in his cool and composed head and how open he was to hear our thoughts as well. Specifically, education sessions showing us other peaks as we traversed the difficult terrain gave us tremendous confidence that we shall now carry with us for the rest of our lives. I am absolutely sure I can name all peaks from Chaukhamba all the way down to Kedar peak when you wake me up from a distant slumber year from today. I also know so many things about plastic waste, segregation and waste management in general thanks to him.
Motivation: He motivated every single person whether fast or slow, fit or unfit, young or old with equal aplomb. In fact, he motivated us so much each minute that each of us trekkers was more than willing to motivate each other in the process. There were tough times when we had soaked socks, iced shoes, times when a couple of our trekkers fell ill and a couple had to walk back on summit day. None of this deterred Avijit from looking beyond his own discomfort and encouraging our lot to do our absolute best. I am happy I was fit enough to be walking beside him as much as possible. 
What happened on the summit day literally brought me to tears. This man, all of 23 years was such an amazing leader that he held the Indian flag high up, obscuring himself from view but ensuring the flag is high and mighty. His impeccable behavior and respect for the mountains brought me to tears. Did I tell you I am not easily moved?
Entertainment: Along with what I consider the above as the perfect package for a trek leader, he has so many hidden talents of mimicry and comedy that he had us in splits. I told you I was fit enough but there were times I was out of breath because my lungs couldn't take any more of my laughing for this man's jokes. Why he does trekking and not stand up comedy is a shock to me.
All these things separately may mean he is just doing a good job but the very fact that he did all of them impeccably well while ensuring that our hearts were in it whether it was related to fitness, trekking, camaraderie, motivation or environment; it was a treat to watch and learn from this true lead

I loved loved loved the trek! This was my first indiahikes trek and I have some acquaintances who have trekked with IH before, they told me I would love it and never trek with any other company again and they were absolutely right! 
Ever since I've come back I'm planning for my next trek with IH. The management, the food, the stay in tents, the activities, the information, the time management, the hydration breaks, our trek leader, Avijit, everything was perfect and splendidly planned. Not only did we have an actual trek experience, but we also had so much fun, made so many friends, danced when we had popcorn as a snack at 10000ft.! The green trails initiative by IH made us aware of the dirt and littering in our mountains and all of us took it as our duty to pick up the litter as we see it. I don't have any suggestions about any changes that should be made because right from our booking confirmation till after our trek, IH has been very very hospitable.

This trek has been an amazing experience for me personally. I loved the way it was executed. Our trek leader Mr. Avijit was of superb guidance and hell of an entertainer. It was a great time with him as I got to learn a lot about the Himalayas. Also, I made some friends which I definitely know will stay lifelong. 
 
I also learned a lot and got motivated to keep the environment clean. Great initiative by India hikes to collect the garbage from our mountains, segregate it in different forms and dispose it in the very right ways. I will definitely follow the same in my city life.
One thing that can be improved can be the rental stuff that is provided could be given in a cleaner and much better condition.

This is the first Himalayan trek, first north trek and first trek with India Hikes for me. I cannot forget the memories, knowledge, courage, and happiness that I received from this. Trek leader Avijit and assistants were of awesome knowledge, perspective to the Himalayas and the path we choose to reach the summit. The courage they give and feed to fellow trekkers gives more energy in order not to feel any kind of dizziness and tiredness. The food was amazing and was available on time every day and was served very hot. Really hats off for the cooks who helped this to happen. On the final day, we had ""Raju da"" along with us in order to support reaching summit. Their timing sense and guidance really make everyone to reach the summit on time and safe.
Amazingly the whole fellow trekkers were so fantastic that it was not like an unknown member, were in every one supported every other as a family and the whole journey of mine made an awesome era of my life.

I had an awesome trek and writing to share my feelings and feedback.
You have a very motivated field team. It was my first winter snow trek and would like to cherish the memories forever thanks to the indiahikes team.
Ayushi was our trek leader and she managed the whole trek in a mature and professional manner.
I was surprised when I learned she is only 21. I do not know from where she gets so much energy and enthusiasm.
Probably she wakes ahead of us, finishes medical tests, kitchen related stuff, gets ready ahead of us, does the trek with us carrying heavy oxygen cylinders and still has energy post-trek to tell stories, manage kitchen (snacks, dinner), etc.
As per her, she does all this as the whole team is like a family for her. That's a big statement.
I felt she is the glue that holds everyone together on the field. Very passionate about her work, great communication skills, very confident and authoritative when needed.
She is a true gem and an asset to Indiahikes and I am sure she has a great future ahead beyond the field.
About our technical guides Sunil, Manoj (Mamaji) and Raju da. They were the best ones with years of experience to guide us through jungle trails, fresh soft snow where there was no trail left.
The last day was a different experience with hard slippery snow. Raju da's perfect instructions and guidance meant that we made the summit and back with great stories to tell.
Also thanks to those unseen faces in the kitchen who fed us lip-smacking meals and kept our morale high.
For a trekker, indiahikes mean these great individuals on field. They make or break the overall experience.
With my trek experience, I can tell you that your organization is in safe hands.
I will come back to the mountains again to repeat the awesome experience and make some more new memories.

Mountains are a wondrous but unfamiliar landscape for most. Whatever you can do to help others feel comfortable (e.g. giving advise on how to stay warm, how to walk on icy terrain), can make a massive difference in their experience and help grow a love of trekking.
The overall experience was very positive and I am pleased that it gave me a chance to meet trekkers from all of India and share some quality time in the mountains.
There were some managerial issues which I feel need to be addressed: first of all, the pick-up at Dehradun. My recommendation: give the driver a list of passengers and ask him to wait in a particular spot in the bus station with a sign ""Indiahikes: Dayara Bugyal"". This way, even if people cannot speak Hindi, they can find the driver and cross their name off the list. This would save a lot of hassle and stress.
If possible, the trek leader should check the trekkers' equipment before leaving base camp and help them gage what they need to take and wear. We had two people in our group wearing track suit bottoms and shoes that were not waterproof, as well as others with rucksacks which were much too heavy. It may be time consuming, but it could really improve trekkers' experiences.
The size of the groups should also be restricted to ensure better experiences for trekkers and an opportunity to form a connection in the team. I would recommend limiting group sizes to 15 people.
We were informed that Indiahikes has specialised ""microspikes"" for walking on ice, however we were not offered any on our decent, which involved an icy trail with patches of 'black ice'. For experienced trekkers this was not an issue, but it would have made the beginners more comfortable and helped reduce the risk of injury from slipping and falling. 
The gear we rented (rucksack and trekking poles) were in good condition, apart from a broken buckle on the rucksack, and were user-friendly. We welcome the initiative to rent out tiffins and mugs and would have liked to have the chance to rent them on our trek.
I was very impressed by Indiahike's Green Trail philosophy and how strictly it was followed by the guides! We were constantly reminded to pick up after ourselves and others and asked politely not to buy anything on route wrapped in plastic. It was a pleasure to walk through clean, unpolluted meadows! Please continue these efforts.
Regarding the fitness test, I believe this is a very important approach and can help make people's experiences much more enjoyable. Unfortunately, given the fitness level of some of the trekkers in our group, it is clear that it is not well enforced.

 The vibe that I got on Summit day is like combination of both happiness and emotional. The day taught me ,this is the life. From the day when I started preparing for the trek to the day of Summit, my life changed a lot. Changed mentally and physically. I'm not a sports person,but for fitness part I started running doing workouts everything. When everyday passes my mind told me ,Yes You Can. But when it turned to the first day of my trek ,I thought of quiting,I dont why.🙄. I couldn't catch up my mind. At that time my trek leader Nithin and fellow trekmate PM ,they stand by my side ,and helped me to route my mind. To motivate me to my dream. From their I walked and walked and reached my dream. Like everyone I'm also happy to see the mountains.But there I saw the mountains all are bonded,just like us. They all are same,just like us.. We all are coming from different cultures,perspectives,... But on those wonderful days, the daytimes,every nights at tents ,the fooding times ,everything we spent together, we're all same, we all are well bonded to each other. Just Like the MOUNTAINS.
First of all,this was my first high altitude trek. More than that this is my first ever solo travel story. The decision for me to do a trek was actually came from a depression. Everyone have a dream to go and explore places in North India ,to see mountains, the snow,. I also have. After completing my studies and entering a job ,I merely forgotten about it. 10 hrs of work!
At first the support trek leader gave to us. For everyone walking from first to last he was with them. The morning warm up activity and the evening discussions were also enjoyable.
Indiahikes is the best one to choose for both the beginer and others. Some of my fellow trekkers were actually planing for their 6th trek with Indiahikes. Green trails was a great initiative taken by indiahikes. To become a part of it during trek is having a responsibility towards nature.

I have learnt a lot about survival in the mountains, alone or in a group.
Where to place the trekking pole, which side to be on when a mule crosses your path, when to  wear spikes and gaitors, and so much more.
Also, there’s so much to take in life. How important human life is, shouldn’t risk it for the sake of climbing. We rejected summit because of heavy snow and the decision was quickly agreed upon by the entire team, very smart choice. Only the mountains decide what itinerary is to be followed in there.

Mental and physical boundaries that I had set for myself are completely broken. Now I know if I set my mind to anything, I can achieve it.
It was a much needed break with beautiful learnings.
At some points there were some confusions with the trek organizers. Mainly the walkie talkie availability, sleeping bag issues and necessary information regarding them, food shortage once or twice.
But those are minor issues, overall, it was amazing nonetheless.
Maybe you can think of making the trekkers pitch their own tents? Because this was a short and easy trek, we were free for most of the times post lunch. Free time could be used in better ways with learning activities
Except for the necessary informations regarding sleeping bags and jakana.
We were never informed about the difference or how to use the jakana. We struggled a lot at night due to the cold.

From the pick up point till the end of the trek everything was spot on!! I want mention specifically Goutham our trek leader , Parvez Rana our trek guide for always being there whenever we needed anything and also the cooking staff for providing us hot food throughout the trek!!
Yeah safety of each individual was taken care very professionally by the trek leader .
The sessions conducted in the free time in the evenings where the trek leader told us about himalayas and what to do when an avalanche hits you etc.. was very informative.
This particular trek was more about mental fitness than physical fitness to me as the trekking part was easy but the weather was tough to handle and the initiative taken by the india hikes to clean the mountains is one of the reason i wanted to trek with india hikes!!

Before signing up this trek I got to hear many comments, regarding that this trekking companies are only selling you the Himalayas with the beautiful attractive images. When you will go there you will find Bislery water bottles. I made my mind right than I will ask the trek leaders if we could do something for this. But in the first met itself the trek leader told about the green trials and how to use eco bags. I was amazed then and there. I can reply my friends now I met Himalayas I saw the Bislery empty bottles and I brought them with me. Great job Indiahikes.
You can’t succeed if you don’t try.You could only fail if you didn’t try. Going out from my comfortzone, cutting down 8 kgs for fitting in the eligibility criteria was something I believe was a remarkable memory from a month before this trek.

The trek poles are a nuisance to carry when you are travelling via flights but indispensable during treks especially winter treks, and therefore renting is the best solution.

The safety standards are more than enough and very good. I liked the initiative that the trek leaders take to check the oxygen and pulse level every evening after the trek. Also I liked this thing that India Hikes takes as a fitness proof before going for the trek, that makes sure that no one is unfit and doesn't make the group slow and also is easy to acclimatize.

The Trek was super amazing to say the least! At first to not reach the summit and Brahmatal campsite was extremely disheartening but nothing can be done with the force of nature and weather conditions.
The unfathomable happiness after reaching Jhandi Top was truly memorable. Each and every day it was a new challenge and hurdle and we had to push a little further to go that extra mile or so!
Thanks to India Hikes for organizing such a wonderful trek, starting from Trek Leader, Guide, Cooks, food safety protocols, other measures followed everything was fantastic! 
I would surely love to go with India Hikes again!!
Things that could have been better:
1) Onward and Return trip cab fare should be included in the Trek fee for all treks, just to make it economical for trekkers
2) Rentals stocks shall be more, poor collection of trekking gear in the website
3) Trek Certificates should be given in hard copy as it motivates in those harsh conditions
4) No campfire should happen in winter treks as it creates air pollution.
5) Better management regarding weather conditions, like refund the money or voucher for some other time in the year or organizing some other trek

In Urban, we tend to care things which are not required and feel pressure on ourselves and whereas in mountains we only think of things which are for survival ie., Food, shelter and clothing. Social Media become integral part of our lives in contemporary world and we may think it is part of existence which is not true in Mountains. We tend to enjoy ourselves and admire beauty of nature.
Brahmthal was an easy trek when compared to my previous high altitude treks. Trek was very scenic. However, I felt bad when heard that we won't be summitting the Brahmthal peak. I can understand life is more important than the summit and we can summit the trek later. I made a lot new friends and trek was enjoyable. I felt trek leader could have engaged the participants little more. Nervethless to say food was amazing. Kudos the support staff and local guides for such lovely hospitality.

From this trek, I've learnt to respect nature more than ever. I've found it to be sacred and my dedication for keeping it clean in every way possible has gone up. 
The gradual change in feelings, the turbulence that was felt during the trek cannot be described in words. It's a life changing experience for me. The staff at Indiahikes was amazing, especially the guides and cooks. Please convey my thanks to them. Also, I was really happy to see that the trek leader was 100% committed to saving the environment. She is doing a lot more to keep our planet clean than most of us so far and that was impressive.

Kedarkantha winter trekking with IH was a fantastic experience. Lots of real life practical learning from the mountains. Some of them are as below:
1. Respect for time
2. Discipline
3. Appreciate what we have, there are bigger problems to solve than what we think we experience
4. Mountains are adaptable to all weather conditions and situations, something that inspires me positively to be like them.

Before signing up for this trekking I had researched a lot for doing this trek and being my first one wanted to have the best of the experiences.
Proud and glad to share IH exceeded the expectations in all areas.
I witnessed one of the best trekking experience with IH and definitely it was genuinely professional in all the departments.
Right from taking us to base camp, awareness briefing sessions, handling the trekking team with all the queries , food quality and more importantly campsite location selection , instructors and guides, routes were perfectly planned and executed.
Special mention for Upendra (Upi bhai) Rawat our trek guide along Afreen mam were simply superb in guiding, motivating and helping with the trek and on basecamp too.
Indeed the safety standards were way ahead than nominal and definitely it reflects the passion of team IH in conducting treks and helps us understand how seriously health is looked after 
Trekking is conducted by many groups but what differentiates IH is with trekking we are also looking at addressing some core environmental issues and with that bringing in self awareness in individuals.
Green trails is classic example.
Another thing that is top priority for any trek enthusiastic person is to be fit to enjoy the journey of summit climb right from day 1 rather merely complete trekking.
Fitness once again IH scores there on being extremely particular.
I think both these core values make undoubtedly the most preferred trekking unit to chose for.

You guys are very professional at every step of the trek. Hats off to our trek leader, Rajarshi, who was humble and patiently handled all of our queries and motivated us with the right spirits which immensely helped few of us reach the summit.

Safety for me and my family is of utmost importance for any of our trips. IH has maintained it with the right gears and equipment required for the trek. The health check were done in a timely manner and our TL advised relevant rest, food or medication required.

The trek went quite well. We also got a great amount of snow as well as snowfall. One thing that we missed is going to the Chandrashila summit. Maybe there was quite a big amount of snow and the trail was not visible. Still, maybe there was the possibility to push to the summit with some really fit trekkers. But it's not that important, we were happy with the overall experience.
Another thing I want to point out is on the fourth day of the trek we needed to descend down the same 4  km that we ascended the previous day to reach the camp and then take a usual road to reach Baniya Kund. I don't know the usual trail was blocked due to snow, but maybe Indiahikes can try to find some alternative trail that will give the trekkers more diversity than traversing the same path twice

The concept of eco bags is brilliant. Even after the trek was over, when I was back in Delhi, I popped open a lays packet, and the cover accidentally fell on the floor. I bent over,  picked it up along with a few of the other plastic items lying on the ground, and then got back up.

Honestly, I would rate this trek 7 on 10. Not for any specific reason but overall. I felt this trek as any ordinary trek.
In terms of rewards that I got, for the money I have invested, in terms of my expectations from the trek, in terms of bond we could create with each other. 
Compared to my previous chandrashila and sandakphu trek, I am bit disappointed now.
Mukta is brilliant. No doubt. But somewhere I felt that IH trekleaders are beyond this and they should be. I have done 2 treks with IH. I have met Bhupi and Akshay. They were perfect.  Trekleaders play important role in carrying out the trek and not just trek but the experience or learnings we get on trek. Mukta seems just like a trekleader. 
I choose trek depending upon their summits. I always look for summit. This time, we could reach upto jhandi top only. Couldn't go to brahmatal. It was sad but no complaints. 
Due to heavy snow and harsh cold, I couldn't explore around the campsite much. I always love to have some 'me time' at the summit. 
On previous treks, some of my team mates got best trekker voucher and greentrail crusader award. This time, no one among us got such sort of voucher. I expected certain people would get best trekker certificate.
Now the things I liked about this trek :
I witnessed shooting stars at bekaltal campsite. Shahi tukda and gulab jamun served as sweet in dinner were delicious. The games we played. Jhandi top view. Lohajung campsite. Thanks for providing 3 layers of sleeping bags. Microspikes and gaters were really helpful.

Indiahikes are great in experience and safety. Trekking gears provided by Indiahikes and its rental store was of great quality. Please maintain the same standards.
I have done trekking with other organizations too but i have not seen any other companies take so much steps to protect nature. Green Trail is very great idea.

The complete trek was beautiful, full of snow and well planned by Indiahikes. We never felt afraid of wildness, or being lost. Everything starting with what is day gonna look like to how are we going to manage weather change was planned in detail. Eating pasta on Himalayan trek made us feel home within wilderness. Guides kept telling us stories about the peaks, motivated us to push ourselves. 
When we think of Himalayan peaks , it seems unfathomable to climb it. But if we take gradual steps, keep up our spirits , it becomes cake walk. Just like the trek , if we keep moving towards our goals, I believe no goal is too big to achieve.
The safety standards set forth were adequate. Our oxygen levels were monitored periodically to ensure we were acclimatizing well. We rented the trekking gears required. Spikes and gators were provided by Indiahikes based on the trail. Overall it was a wonderful experience.

It was my first experience of trekking in the Himalayas. I was amazed by the preparations and information given to us. While we missed visiting the Brahmatal top, the visit to Ajan top on the first day was indeed a splendid experience. Getting to eat a dessert even at the top of the mountains in cozy tents was beyond my expectations.
The first and foremost was connecting with people. Being a solo traveler, I usually end up gelling with people, but in the mountains, its more of a co-living like a family since we need to look out for each other. While I am mostly an introvert at times, I was surprised by how my tentmates Rahula and Ritesh got along and tolerated me throughout the trek. It was an eye-opener about trusting people and being in the moment.

With respect to the safety standards, at no point in time did I feel the team was ill or unprepared for any foreseen situations that could arise.
I am awed by the values at India Hikes and impressed by everyone's adherence to it.
This is what differentiates the best from the others.

The Green Trails is such a brilliant initiative to leave the mountains better than we found them. Sadly on this trek, we were barely able to collect any waste as everything was covered under snow. But I do appreciate the emphasis that IH put on generating minimum waste. It was always at the back of my mind to not dispose of the waste in the bins provided to us but to carry it back to the city.
I have already mentioned how IndiaHikes Fitness requirements actually made me lose 20 kgs in 6 months. 
PS: I am already planning for another trek to get rid of those extra pounds and be fitter to enjoy the more difficult treks.

ONE WORD - FANTASTIC !!
We moved together as a team, became friends. It was a mix of youngsters and elderly trekkers. Seniors kept talking to us and giving us life lessons, sharing their experiences of life and previous treks, which made the trek so beautiful and we missed each other departing to our places.
Right from BP check to Oxymeter check, the IH staff took care of each and everything. Oxymeter check was done at regular intervals making sure none suffer in the trek.
We got to see snow on the first day of the trek and seeing snow for first time was very special. And finally we enjoyed snowfall on the last day of the trek. And everyone made it to the summit and completed the trek.
The TL and guides made sure we are on the right track and enjoying at the same time. They use to give information of the trial and surrounding mountains, which made us more interested in other treks as well.
FOOD had been amazing. I would like thank the India Hikes for providing us delicious food at the higher altitudes along with hot water for drinking purposes.
ECOBAG - A fabulous initiative in Keeping the mountains clean. I collected few plastic bottles, chips packets etc on the trial. I'm really happy that I contributed a little for Green Trails.
India Hikes made sure we trek responsibly and we did.  
I made sure i was exercising regularly before the trek. I keep doing that as I'm planning for more treks in the future with India Hikes.

The food was quite decent too. The views were absolutely magnificent. All in all, it was truly a great experience and I'd love to trek with INDIAHIKES again.
Indiahikes does indeed follow stringent protocols and I believe it is for the best. Health should always be the first priority. I think that the regular health checkups are an excellent way to be updated with the acclimatization of various individuals on the trek. A proper medical certificate from a medical practitioner was also required before the trek.

Avijit told us innumerable mythological stories along the way and kept us all motivated all the time. The strain of trekking was not felt much. Every day was a different excellent achievement and felt we could do more. The food was too very good and inviting and served hot. Excellent arrangements you have.
We heard a lot about how Indiahikes stared the winter treks and how new treks are initiated.
I am very happy about how you educate the trekkers on minimal wastages and how to manage the waste and keep your environment clean and healthy. Punctuality is one more great lesson I learned along the trek.

I learnt a lot about myself through this trek, qualitites like endurance, reselience and how I handle tough situations.
I love trekking with IH and would suggest a lot of friends to trek with India Hikes although there were time management issues from the trekkers and sometimes we had to wait after getting ready to start the trek. The time delay was mainly due to repacking by the trekkers at the campsite. A little briefing on how to pack and unpack a rucksack in a trek would be very helpful in my opinion.
There was some confusion with the transition from the basecamp to the vehicles on the last day. Recce of the safer routes by the trek leaders could be suggested.
All the safety equipments are gear were taken care of smoothly.
I rented a jacket and trek pole and am very satisfied with the service you offer at reasonable prices for international travellers as well
The trek leaders were very engaging . I love the passion and commitment they put in every single thing.
Deep and Pranav were amazing leaders.
Specially I love Pranav, his calmness, passion and positiveness made me feel so confortable all the time.
I really appreciate green trails initiative and the way leaders share thier knowledge and commitment with environment. Really believe this has a positive impact on trekkers.

It is a divine feeling to be in the mountains. You can feel the presence of the divine in the serene nature and tranquility of the summits.The overall trek experience was amazing but felt the quality of food was not good as compared to my previous trek with IH.
Safety standards are perfectly upto the mark. Renting gear actually helped a lot and avoided carrying of unnecessary loads. The warm up and relaxation excercises conducted by the trek leaders were very much fun.
The fitness standards followed by you make the trekking experience more joyful. The Green Trails is genuinely a novel  concept but I did not find  anybody much enthusiastic about this noble contribution, in this batch. The trek leaders too failed to motivate the trekkers towards it.

Warmup excercises are a must I feel before a trek and these excercises conducted by the trek leaders were very helpful.
The trek leaders educate us a lot about the Green Trails which is a great initaitve by IH but more participation by the trekkers is needed according to me .

My trek started on 09-Dec-2019 instead of 8-Dec-19, after I fell ill on route to Lohajung due to motion sickness in 13 hour long journey from Rishikesh on 07-Dec-19. 
But once I recovered with the help of Trek Leader Anuj and Gaurav at Lohajung (who really motivated me and gave me medicines and a day's rest on my request) and started the trek, it was totally a fulfilling and enriching experience for me. The best part I liked about the trek was how nicely it was planned and the after every treacherous climb, we took a break to recover the strength. It made the climb much easy than they were.
The camp sites were clean and so were the sleeping bags and tents. And the food at all three camp sites as well as the base camp was truly great. The delicious sweet dish every night was something to look forward to and unexpected at such high altitude.
The trek gave me the strength to just keep moving forward and it taught me alot about my body and what it can achieve with perseverance.
I met wonderful friends on the trek, with who I'm sure I'll be in touch with in future who made the trek even better. We heard stories from our Guides Gopal ji and Sunil ji and other members at the camp site. They were always around for any help we needed during the trek.
The trails in the mountains were really clean and Green trails initiative clearly showed us it's benefits.
Safety standards on the trek along with health check ups were followed stringently during the trek. So they were really good.

I rented trekking shoes, Trekking pole and a Jacket from the base camp. Shoes and pole were perfect and really helped me all through the trek. However ,I felt the condition of the Jacket could have better as the zips were not in the perfect condition and gave trouble during opening and closing. Other than that, gear was good.

Being the first trek, I was anxious about everything. from my health, my stamina to the company I have selected for this trek. I am glad to say that I made the right choice. Starting from pick up to base camp, all the experience was smooth enough to make you comfortable. 
Base camp transfers: Vehicle was in good condition and spacious enough for comfortable seating
Welcome: The entire staff came to welcome the group. The introduction session was conducted by the leaders. Expectation setting was completed professionally
Ascend and Descend: Trek leaders age group was 21-25 years. They were the most active and healthiest in the lot :) Strong enough to be reliable with any injury or weight. Motivated enough to not let you give up at all. Patient enough for a slow pacer like me. Special mention to Avijit - Trek Leader who was adamant that he would not let me give up, Aayushi - Asst. Trek leader who would not stop motivating me and was with me all the time and Yashpal - Helper / Assistant on the summit day - Without him, it would have been difficult to complete the trek. All 3 of them did not show a sign of frown and were more than happy to be able to help the entire team achieve the summit
Facilities: Eco toilets, clean tents, clean sleeping bags, and rented equipment. All are in good and hygienic conditions. Safe to use... 
Food: Super yummy food. In the price they charge, variety and quality of food are least expected. However, food is one reason, that would make me do another trek. Hot breakfast, lunch, and dinner unless you have a long day and have a packed lunch or snack. Unlimited food so no restriction. Dal, roti, sabzi, salad, papad and sweet. Super cold weather and soup is served :) 
Hence, I said, A-Z, Indiahikes is perfect and professional. 
Changes / Suggestion:
1) We were informed during Day 1 of the briefing that if oxy levels are low or BP is high, a person can be sent back anytime. I did not read this anywhere on your site. It must be there somewhere. However, I would suggest you mention this as a Warning especially people who suffer from high BP are mentally prepared. 
2) Security deposit: We have rented the gear but did not remember reading anything about a security deposit. Ignore if this is mentioned in the rental section. If not, I would advise you to add it so people carry extra cash...

I would like to present a special token of appreciation for the Trek Guides, they were humble and very cordial, genuine persons.
And our team leader was very sincere and up to the task. Job well done.

The safety standards were all in a good place and very much need of the hour. I am satisfied with all the protocols and standards Indiahikes designed for our security and safety. Green Trails is a very good initiative. As said by Rabindranath Tagore, ""Let me light my lamp and please don't debate whether it will remove the darkness or not.""
This initiative is the need of the hour, humans are destroying everything they set their feet on. It is also the responsibility of humans to restore nature back to its original condition. We can't only be leeches sucking the marrow out of our mother nature. I thoroughly enjoyed this initiative and felt very proud of being a part of it.

This was my best trek till now and thanks to the entire team. 

Everybody should rent a gear rather than buying such expensive stuffs, which is very nice, clean and pocket friendly.
I rented four things i.e. trek pole, jacket, poncho and shoes which all was in a good condition and i would prefer renting rather than buying.
As soon as i applied for har-ki-dun i was getting each and every small details about the trek that  i am going  on which includes how to get fit for the trek what to carry and  what not to carry how much to carry and they also provide rentals which is also very easy and convenient . They inspire you daily to get fit for the trek which is easy for the trekker to get before the trek. As a individual i believe in cleanliness and green trail, in this part IndiaHikes is playing a excellent role to keep the trails clean which is the primary reason why i love indiahikes .

This was my first snowfall experience of my life. In all we got experience of an autumn and a winter trek in one go which was simply superb. The views were mind blowing. I had an awesome experience!!

This was my third trek and first with indiahikes and I must say I have not seen such safety measures and protocols being followed by other trekking companies. Being a doctor myself I know the importance of regular monitoring at higher altitudes. This is a very important initiative which helps in preventing medical situations which may get difficult to handle.

The trek was awesome in many respects.
- Trek leader was great and managed such a large group at harsh conditions brilliantly.
- Guides with us were very supportive an took care of us throught the trail
- Cooks were also awesome, they just brought us to life every meal time with healthy, simple and tasty foods
- Learnings were also great. They taught us how to pitch and unpitch the tent, properly backpack, keep our breathing steady and other stuffs which made this trek smmoth
- Weather God favoured us a bit with sun throughout the trail and snow when we campled to Ruinsara. So we saw every part of nature from dirt to snow to mud.
The only thing that I was lokking forward to but couldn't get was a technical knowledge on how to trek. Like fro example how to put forward your steps when you ascend or when you descend, how to avoid knee injury, ankle injury during trek, type of gears required during journey and to use them properly. Though I remember our guides pointing to us when we made mistakes or more safe approaches but it would have been great if it was a part of formal instructions like pitching and unpitiching tent.
I think fitness is utmost important if you want to enjoy the trail or even complete it. So this will motivate me to get more fitter for future treks. 
Green trails is very good initiative. It reminds us that we mustn't destroy the beauty of the mountains that we are appreciating now. I remember we stopped for a lunch with some another trek group of another company. Not one of us ordered Maggie or other packaged product from the stall, despite seeing the other group ordering it. We just ordered tea and had our packed lunch. This showed how we adopted green trail. So its a very good intiative and I would suggest you to continue this more aggressively.

Dayara Bugyal trekking was a wonderful experience. IH team was efficient and well prepared to lead the team. They were on their toes, especially our trek leader Ayushi was awesome! She made sure all of us drank water, made us feel comfortable, would check on us if we are taking our medications on time if any, motivated us ...
Loved the yummy food after a tiring trek. Food was not oily, not spicy but well prepared for every one's palette and was really appreciated. Oh and the surprise dessert would make the meal complete. :-)
IH team let us trek in our own pace, there were a few of us who would be in the tail end and we would have Baldev Bhai motivating us. The whole trek was organised very well. Team lead made sure we reached the summit well on time to avoid any sudden weather changes. On the whole was a lovely experience!
Core values of IH - I think is to make the trekking experience for each and every person a memorable one.
Safety and Puncutality.
After being on the trek realised how important fitness was and why our coordinator was pushing us before the trek and making sure we were exercising.
Green trails - making the mountains cleaner, toilet pits, taking back the sanitary napkins, composting wet waste all are very good initiatives.

My 4th trek with Indiahikes confirms my trust with the trekking community. Its wonderful philosophy of giving back to mother nature is very appreciable. Fitness is given high priority. The local staff is very dedicated to the hospitality of the trekkers. Awesome food and interactive activities make it even better.
Green trails is a unique initiative in today's world. The trekkers making an effort to clean the environment are a great realization for the passer-by and locals. Each hand makes an effort to make the environment cleaner and greener.
Overall, Thank you IH for the extraordinary experience once again!

I was a beginner with a lot of 'what ifs'. Having to complete this trek helps me to start believing in myself. I shouldn't doubt my capabilities to go extra miles and never self reject. I am stronger than what i can think of :)

Fitness is the base of anything that you can imagine. Be it a healthy life in the city or the stamina you need to trek in extreme weather or trails. A regular workout is very important.
Also,  the Green trail initiative is an awesome way to reduce waste in the mountains and spread awareness about the hazards of spreading your personal wastes. It felt great in contributing to waste collection and segregation.

This is so true. As working adults living in cities, there is an abrasion of the deep values that connect us to nature and our own selves. It has been a few years since I really tried to achieve something that seems impossible at first. DC was one such challenge, and I felt so refreshed to work up the dormant determination and actually stretch to achieve something (reaching the peak!!). 
I also realized that we need very few material things if we can find other natural ways of fulfillment (or pass time). I didn't use half of the things carried in my bag, and the phone was switched off for 6 days. It was really a different way to live. Seeing the simple and yet difficult lives of the local villagers were also eye-opening - how they walk long distances, work hard to maintain their land and crops, and live in harmony with nature.

Trek went very well. Starting out with a low bar for a 4-day trek, I was able to go through the four days of enjoyable treks and with a lot of support, encouragement and best-of-class company with the gung-ho youngsters, I achieved way more than my own expectations. Logistics and arrangements were well taken care of, setting the right expectations about the convenience and comfort at the campsites. Healthy, well-planned meals - even though 4 of them a day felt an overkill, and timely setup and close-downs were very well done. Preparedness for rain and adverse climate were communicated early enough that we were neither surprised nor inconvenienced. Pleasant and helpful trek lead (Adi is a phenomenon, by the way) and the guides (Manoj and Mayank) were always in the thick of things and made me feel I could climb Mt Everest...

Trek went above my expectations.
Food exceeded my expectations by miles. Are you sure you are not pampering us with such great food in such high altitude? I have not done any previous treks, so I cant compare tough.  :D
Tanmay, our trek leader was the huge factor our group bonded so well and cared for each other. The way he handled the vomiting and other gastro illness two trek-mates got, were so good that we didn't had to leave anyone behind.
The overall positive and great helpful mindset of Sandeep, Guddu, and Hari(the technical expert we had for summit crossing day) are all highlights i take away from this trek.
One thing I learned is if I trust these guys and their experience, the trek becomes very easy. This became more relevant on the summit crossing day. I truly enjoyed the descending from the summit onwards, through that snow. Some of the footsteps I stepped in(I was right behind Hari, the technical expert), I was submerged into snow upto my groin. All I had to do was be confident and follow him as he instructed. For me that day ended up being the most thrilling out of the 8 days. 

Personally I believe this trek changed my life style a bit. the requirements challenged me to quit smoking and I did that during May 2019. From June on wards I started jogging and by August I had my best time or 5 Kms in 27.05 minutes. This is part of the journey as I take it. Its a big challenge now to hold on to this change and its for me to try hard. 
The green trails initiative from your side is so commendable, that simple words are not enough. I am very happy to be a tiny part of it. All the words of awareness and your values probably make India hikes moving a bit ahead of your times, that it may seem not much appreciation from general public. But I am really hopeful soon official honors will come to Indiahikes.

The trek was fabulous. Despite the crowd and paved steps on some sections of the trek, the challenge, breathtaking views of the peaks, lakes, forests and the camaraderie of the group made it very very enjoyable. The brilliant weather also aided to a great extent. Respect for the mountains and the challenges it would throw at us made all of us in the group prepare well and work hard on our fitness prior to the trek. This was a key reason for all of us enjoying the trek so much. Had even one of us been less fit, it would have impacted the group as a whole adversely.  
The sensitivity and consideration shown by everyone in the group and the sportive spirit that all displayed made it a wonderful and memorable experience. 
The safety standards were right up there and the excellent knowledge and commitment of the team leader to health and safety were a major positive. Most of us had need for some tablet or the other from time to time, for some minor issue, and it was very reassuring to have a Team Leader whom we could rely upon for proper advice and support. 
This is one criteria on which IH stands unique and should continue to stay that way.
The Tea Houses were nice and comfortable everywhere. So did not have a need for tents or sleeping bags anywhere. 
IH's commitment to the environment, safety, insistence on fitness, quality of equipment, excellent capability and experience of the Team leaders, strict enforcement of the 'no tobacco/alcohol' policy on treks, are all factors that I personally find extremely laudable and desirable. These are the main reasons why I always choose IH for any Himalayan trek that I or my family do.

Your destination may look near but it may not be that close.
Things need to be taken to completion by taking baby steps towards the goals and it is not done until it is done. What matters most is the journey and all you need to think is about the next step towards your goal and the goal itself. 
Trek was fantastic. We did face some weather related issues as it was raining the first day. But thankfully it stopped for the coming days, only some light drizzles. Overall the trekking experience was good.
Food was amazing, the trek leads did exceptional job. We never faced much issues. 
Fitness is very important to complete a high altitude trek. Weather conditions, altitude gain, long distances and the terrain are the major challenges.
I love the fitness assessment done by India Hikes before each trek. The running proof, the oxymeter readings during the trek, the emergency measures and guidance around medications and the medical certificate are some really cool measures followed. Also, the dedication to keeping the mountains and the nature clean is something I haven't seen a lot of other agencies do.

457,Santosh Kumar,2019-09-01,Beas Kund,"
I learnt 3 things and shared during the trek with all the mates- 
1. As you go up all the big (materialistic things for which you were fighting) become very small... so it’s important for you to forget/ignore small things and go up in the ladder!
2. As you go up you have to keep your load minimum as possible and shed a lot of load to move easily- directly related to life! 
3. Even a single wrong step on the trek (ascending or descending) can change the situation and you very clearly see the consequences- one side 5000 ft valley and other side the water fall... so you take each and every step consciously! However in life because you don’t see the consequences of wrong step immediately- you become unconscious until you face any consequences and you correct yourself! It’s important to be anticipative and conscious to check wrong steps!
I really liked the clarity and expertise the trek leader/guides have in their work, very clear daily/timely instructions, prime focus on safety and green trail are outstanding! 
A delicious hot nutritious meals at 10,000 feet are ADD ONs... did not expect such affection and taste in the meals! 
The Beas Kund trek is exciting where you have an opportunity to see variety of terrains- greens, rocks, along river on the peak and dangerous summit! 
Amazing view of 3 peaks snow laden- friendship peak, hanuman Tibba and also 7 sisters! 
We experienced all the 4 weathers- sunshine, heavy winds, rains and hailstorms- this made our trek more adventurous!
The great companions made the trek memorable!
I strongly recommend for INDIA Hikes to anybody going for exciting treks for an amazing experience/memory! 
5/5 rating from me!Excellent! Since I was the oldest 45+ yrs, it was important for me to check safety aspects - IL the trek leader was very professional and did his job of health check up, safety focus very diligently.

Trek was amazing. The whole trek was better than expected or even mentioned in the IndiaHikes videos/blogs. I already mentioned this during the discussions on the last day of trek - the stillness of the mountains and the landscape brings that pause in your life when you are just left with yourself and your thoughts (the famous song from Kabhie Kabhie, main aur meri tanhai... :)). We need this pause in our lives from the hustle bustle of urban and family life and focus (may be on yourself).

Fitness really helped. Better fitness ensured that I was able to complete the trek without any hiccups. Green Trails is in fact a learning that I took away for the rest of my life. Also, we were quite fortunate to have a great group of trekkers (incl. the trek leader) which helped us in building the cohesiveness required.

Special mention to our trek leader Geet.The gem of a person. More than trek leader he was part of the trek that made trek even more enjoyable.

I would definitely like to mention the activity conducted by  trek leader geet at chandranahan lake. I don't remember when was last time I wrote a hand written letter to someone. Geet conducted activity where we sat quietly at site and wrote a handwritten letter to anyone we want. Sitting in beautiful nature and writing a letter was indeed a amazing experience and totally enjoyed some quite time I had.

As every trek we were part of fitnees and green trails, before the trek indiahikes made sure that we are maintaining fitness routine by running daily 5 kms. I think this is very necessary as trek likes buran ghati requires great fitness. Regarding green trails, I really liked the ided of keeping eco bag on entire trek and making sure we collect every waste.  trek leader also provide information of different type of waste which can be recycled which is something we can apply on our day to day life also.

First of all, thank god Indiahikes exist ;) This is my second trek with India hikes, and there is absolutely no doubt, I would choose Indiahikes over any other trek organizers for all my future treks. 
The whole experience was incredible. Right from the day we were all picked from Shimla on time, to the day we were dropped off back to our respective places, everything was on time, highly professional and caring staff, entertaining and educating guides.
Food served was sumptuous and nutritious. All the staff members were extremely friendly. Day 1 to day N Briefings were very elaborate and informative.

 
Its always when we register for the treks, we start the habit of running, and it continues even after the trek is completed. I have made running part of my workout routine since the time I went on my first trek last year. 
It's great that Indiahikes gives atmost importance to the trekker's fitness regimes and takes it very seriously. We get a sense of responsibility when we are asked to be able to achieve certain level of fitness.
The green trails initiative is an excellent program. It makes us re-think every time we use plastic/paper unnecessarily. It also helps to create awareness in trekkers to maintain the clean trails as much as possible.
Our trek lead Geet was just amazing. He got along the team so very well that we felt he is part of our group. His briefing was very crisp and clear. Geet kept us engaged throughout the trek with lots of fun activities. Along with the games, he also conducted informative discussions on wildlife, climate change, avoiding the usage of plastics etc. We would love to get him as our trek lead in our future treks.

I think the biggest thing for me was that I was living in the moment during the trek. Enjoying the scenery all along the way. Concentrating on just the next step during the difficult parts. How easy life becomes when you do this! Also, the fact that you don’t need so many material things to be happy. 
I loved the trek. As a first timer to overnight treks, there were so many new experiences for me. Took me totally out of my comfort zone. And made me realise that it wasn’t bad - outdoor toilets, 3 to a tent, sleeping bags, changing without privacy, not having a bath for 3 days. It was not a big deal at all. 
The trek was not a cake walk. It was challenging. But I managed to do it. And took inspiration from the young trekkers around me. 
Loved that the trek covered hills, plains, water bodies. 
I also appreciated the advice I got from Nayana and Manisha about what shoes to buy and also backpacks. There was a lot of handholding through emails before the trek, which I really appreciated. 
Suhas was very patient with us while we were asking him so many questions before finalising in which trek to go on. The umpteen videos of Swati that I watched also helped me. Finally, given my age, I had some apprehensions about how I would cope. While I did my part with training, I do appreciate the encouragement I received from the other trekkers as well as our trek leader Aditya 😊🙏🏿  
I absolutely loved the pitching and unpitching of the tents. It felt so good learning to do that. 
Also liked the game of self introduction of participants in the dining tent. 
The last feedback session was also good. And other games too.

The biggest one was ""No turning back"". There was one point while we were heading to Jwara and there came a path with boulder on one side of a narrow path with a steep valley on the other side. I thought, probably this will demand an emergency call back home. But that didn't happen. First day in Jobra and again in Jwara, I was wondering what have I signed up for, but eventually reaching Hampta Pass, it was a sweet reminder of what one gets for not giving up. Absolutely loved the experience. Already planning for the ones I will go next year, but fitter and stronger.
Best part was that everybody could complete it. The energy of the group was different on the day of accomplishment. We also met few very fit trekkers in Balu ka Ghera and that boosted the morale as well. The though of 9km trek on Day 3 was daunting but climbing through rocks, trekking on the snow and eventually witnessing the beauty from 14035 feet was simply unreal. The trek was taken seriously with good prep work, it paid off!
Green Trails is the need of the hour. I think, more people will now explore the idea of going on high altitude treks and the chances of the Himalayas getting littered will be high. As such, it is of primary importance to leave the mountains in their pristine form that has been since ages. I really felt proud of myself and the group when I saw the segregated waste we had collected during the trek. Left the Himalayas cleaner than how we found them.

My sincere thanks to the cooks for providing us with nutrition filled meals throughout the day and special mention to the sweets. Hats off to the team on the ground. Thanks a lot and without them, this would not have been possible.

The safety standards were absolutely wonderful! That's precisely one of the reasons why I choose Indiahikes and didn't even consider any other trekking group. It was great and very helpful to have a technical person on the day of the pass crossing. Certain sections were tricky and thanks to the technical person, trek leader and a couple of guides (Rohit and Gollu), these sections were doable and safe.
I would like to thank Indiahikes for stressing on the fitness - if not for this, it would have been difficult for me to complete the trek with carrying my bagpack. Please folllow this and ensure that the trek members are always fully fit before they reach the base camp. Thanks.
I really admire the Green Trails initiatives but to be 100% honest, after one point in time, I didn't pick up as waste as one would expect. Will improve on this aspect next time. Thanks.

For the seemingly never-ending undulating carpet of lush green as far as the eye can see culminating in the climax of Gidara End which can best be described as a portal to another world with mesmerizing scenery straight out of the Lord of the Rings.  Add to that the excitement of the ridge walk to Gidara Top with the Bugyal extending to infinity on one side and the other side dropping down steeply to a beautiful valley.

I wish we could describe it one line!
But words just cannot describe how each of us felt during the Gidara Bugyal Trek.
For me, it was my maiden Himalayan trek. Before Indiahikes decided on this one, we were contemplating between Deorital Chandrashila trek and Dayara Bugyal. The fact that it was the first by Indiahikes got us excited. A maiden trek meant untravelled paths, less trekkers and a unique experience. It was all of this and much more. 
For those 5 days, I think we time travelled to another world with a bunch of individuals so diverse from yourself, yet you could be your most vulnerable with them.
The diverse shades of green, brown and blue with clouds playing hide and seek and giving us wallpaper shots every single moment. The ridge walk was extraordinary. Taking it all in was difficult because there was so much of it. Mother nature was generous every single day on this trek. 
We overcame fear. Fear of heights, fear of altitude sickness, fear of just giving up and not being able to push yourself. 
It'll be unfair if I don't specify our campsites especially knowing how much work went into creating one. Every campsite was fantastic!
Our trek leader, Nitesh, not only ensured we had a great experience on the trek but also made us more aware of our environment and how sustainability is the only way to survive.
Gidara Bugyal has created a niche in the best memories all of us have and that'll stay forever 😊

A trek on a meadow is completely undone and unheard by my troop and while Dayara seemed fairly easy and short, the Gidara trek popped up one fine day. It looked interesting but not too many pictures to back up the entire trek. While sceptical about the trek not happening due to the shortage of numbers, we signed up anyway and were super glad to be part of a small but aptly diverse group.
It's one thing to sign up for a trek on seeing the wonders of it or hearing about it, but being able to create the memories first hand and experiencing every bit of a maiden trek in true form has been amazing.
Gidara on its own is not to be undermined for a trek and never could one imagine that a meadow could be so freakin' huge. Mighty and daunting and one that brought tears, smiles, challenges and thrill, this trek is close to hearts on many many levels and memories remain as fresh as yesterday

Fitness norms should be strict and compulsorily followed by the trekkers as in mountains health is not a thing which we can take casual or easy
Green trail idea is awesome. I liked it very much....
Thankyou Indiahikes... for teaching me about green trails.

The trek was amazing, trek leader Samkit and Trek guide Vipindra took utmost care of us. Samkit was an amazing leader and patient throughout the trek and looked after every trekker carefully. Indiahikes has some of the best cooks who provided hot lunch at given time and food were different every other day, tents were cosy and sleeping bags gave warmth, I used to sleep like a baby after every trek. I wouldn't like Indiahikes to change this.

Few of the life lessons I learned from the trek is never give up. There's always hope for something better. I loved the trek, this was my second trek through India hikes. The campsite was soothing, the weather just perfect, the mist traveling around the campsite was like travelling through my mind, washing off my worries. 
Aditya Pillai, our trek leader was always taking care of all trekkers esp when we were at the summit and he warned us at the very time that the weather could get worse and we reached the campsite just in time. Coming to safety standards, from health check ups to renting gears is always good. Aditya was very diligent when it came to health check card. 
 I rented poncho and a trek pole. The gears are very clean, hygienic and well maintained. 
I have always abide by rules of keeping the nature clean, be it plastic or paper. India hikes have kept it strict when it comes to green trails. Fitness is a core value of India hikes, if we need to enjoy the treks then ones fitness is a must amd India hikes have always followed something they believe in.

I went to Bali pass with my wife. We've done a few high altitude treks before but this one proved out to be toughest of them all. I think the biggest take-away for me is that we got back with an even stronger bond in our relationship. As they say, what doesn't kill you, only makes you stronger! :) 
This was my 2nd trek with IH this year(probably 5th or 6th trek with IH overall). I would say Sankri is one of the best base for IH - staff is super-nice, warm and friendly. Food is the best.
Bali pass is a complete trek..lush green fields and forests, local villages, serene trails, pristine views of 7,000 mtr peaks, high altitude meadows, river crossing, thrill, adrenaline and long pass days. One of the best treks for me so far. 
The icing on the cake - A small batch of only 6. We went up as strangers and came back as a family! 

Except for white-out, snow and rains on the pass day, we had good views throughout the trek :)

This trek was one of the most awesome experience of my life till date. This got me so close to the nature in a way which I had never experienced.
The 15 mins which I spent in silence at the Chandrabahan lake was such a relaxing moment which I cannot even describe.
I will not say that the whole trek was a piece of cake because it was not. This being my first trek I found some areas to be very difficult and challenging and with the help of the trek leader, the 2 guides as well as my fellow trekkers I could manage to complete the trek.
I personally found coming down to be more difficult that climbing up and here the guide Hemraj was really helpful in guiding me about the right technique which helped on the day of the pass crossing as well

Buran ghati trek was a unique experience for me as this was the first trek I was doing with my wife and it was the first himalayan trek for her. 
The grand mountains and pass of Butan ghati was a superb experience for us to bond even more and face a few unprecedented challenges together. 
The entire support staff from the trek leader to kitchen staff were very helpful and took very good care of the group. They went out of their way to help us on a few occasions. That to me is commitment and care at the highest level. Seldom found in our busy lives in Cities!

Stringent pre trek fitness helped me and my wife cope up with the challanges of trail that we faced. We could not only cope up with the trail but also enjoy the vast natural beauty around. 
I appreciate the green trail initiative of India hikes and support them in all the work that they are doing to keep our mountains clean.

The trekking activities of each day were planned so well that no day seemed too exerting. The food preparations were also very thoughtfully planned and executed. The most memorable was 'gulab jamun' at 13000 ft.

 Right advices were given. My BP was not so good, the previous day and was clearly explained that if numbers dont improve summit would not be possible. 
It was a very non-negotiable decision. Thanks so much. The mountains always teaches me to be confident irrespective of the surroundings. Wonderful part is the world it opens us to.

The entire trek was amazing. The food was amazing. I would like to thank Krunal, Rahul and Rafiq for motivating us throughout and keeping us entertained when we were at the campsite. It never felt as if they were the guides and they were different from us. They were also a part of the huge family. I loved every bit of the trek and I'm looking forward to book another one soon with Indiahikes. Regarding the fitness part, It was really good to see people taking it up seriously and go for the 5k run. I finally had a reason to wake up early and do something to keep myself fit.

The entire Indiahikes team did a great job to make sure everything was smooth. From the Trek Coordination and motivation before the trek, the safety, the food, the assistance, the awareness, and knowledge shared and the support of the fellow members all made it a brilliant experience. Special thanks to Krunal and Rafique ji. It's good to know that we are not  amongst those causing harm to the environment in the name of trekking but also helping to solve other issues and bring about awareness. It feels like we were all on one mission towards a better world and I loved that about Indiahikes. This is something many of us would take back home and also share with others.

The trek was awesome. I enjoyed it right from the beginning..which includes the emails insisting upon keeping up fitness standards even before the trek started. The safety standards are of the highest order.  Indiahikes team started emailing us three months prior to commencement of the trek about physical fitness. Health certificates, which shows their commitment to safety standards. We were forced to keep ourselves well hydrated throughout the trek and everyday health checkups were conducted. This is my first trek but I think we couldn't have had better safety standards. It is very important for the trekkers to be physically fit to have a safe trek.

Indiahikes team is stringent about the fitness standards which is really good for the trekkers..also the green trail concept is really great..it feels good to trek in a clean and green environment and Indiahikes is contributing beautifully to it by educating the trekkers on green trail concept..they collect the waste on their trails which is segregated at the end and is even utilized to help locals economically.

Two things that the mountain trek taught me. That apart from talent, skill, supporting conditions etc, it is the will power that is most important to achieve anything in life, and to perform upto your expectations.
Secondly, in life, like in trekking, one should focus on the next step, the next slope or the next climb, that is one step at a time, and not confuse and clutter one's mind with future thoughts and long distance goals. The trek went very well. It was a smooth climb towards high altitude, with average 2000ft climb each day, and thus helped us to acclimatise better to high altitude. The food and tent arrangements were also good. Regular health check ups were very important and a good feature of the trek. Trek leader and the other staff's role was very crucial and they were very helpful. The trek leader helped us to know a lot of basic things about trekking, mountains, green trails and related things, which was very informative. Overall, it was a great learning experience.our nature is degrading fast due to plastic waste and other problems due to human intervention. Green trails is a small but significant step to make our planet green, save the nature and inculcate a sense of responsibility among trekkers, and local people about the significance of clean and green nature.

The mountains have taught me take care of the beauty that it has.
Leave the mountains how you found it. Do not dirty it. Help in making it cleaner.
Do not make loud noises and disturb the animals or stones living there.
I have thoroughly loved the trek and however hard I think, I am unable to think of anything which should be changed. Tanmay and the boys were amazing - warm, friendly and lots of fun. What any trekker would expect from the guides. I really appreciate the emphasis on the fitness India Hikes gives. This is very important and I have learned it as I worked through the process a month before the trek. Maintaining the health card and tracking our pulse and heart rate keeps us rest assured that we are doing okay which is very good. The food was great and the Company was amazing. 
Beas Kund is a beautiful trek, it is a visual treat however it would not be a success if all this planning and effort is not put in. If not for anything the eco bag creates a mindset not to litter. I was very cautious to put all the litter in it and then was amazed how all team mates took the effort to collect the litter from what they came across as well. With the growing number of trekkers the green trail is a great initiative. Wish all trekking companies follow this.

It is always a pleasure to be back with India hikes for any of their treks. The discipline they maintain and the important instructions which they provide us shows a lot about their commitment towards protecting the people, animals and also the mother nature. The safety standards are very good. Begining from the day u have registered for the trek, there are mails sent out to everyone to get fit and be ready for the trek. There is consistant monitoring done and also during the treks, the checkups and followups are done in a systematic way to ensure saftety all the way

To be more conscious of the waste that I am generating. (Inspiration- Green trails and Areeb )
my phone had stopped working as soon as I reached Manali and being without connectivity for 4 days taught me a lot about how much beauty we're missing out. it also helped me realise that being connected emotionally and physically is so much more important than just being connected virtually.
This might we bordering on 'too much information' but this  was my first trek and it helped me gain clarity over my career goals  and also certain personal relationships which were messed up.
I am not sure whether it was just the mountains, the fresh air that we breathed or just the whole experience together but it really helps you introspect.
Reiterating, the Green trails project is something I truly love, admire and appreciate. I'm certain that the little difference that Indiahikes makes will go a long way and will definitely be appreciated by the locals, government and others.
Thank you for following a great routine regarding fitness as well, because I was really worried that I wouldn't be able to trek easily. But if you follow each instruction, it really isn't that difficult. 
The best part about the trek was the company. From the local guides, to the trek leader, to our group of 11 who came to Manali as strangers but left as a family. Thank you for a wonderful experience!

One major lesson that I learned about myself is that we can reach any goal you set no matter how difficult it may look. Small steps at a time and a hardship can give you breath taking views on Mountains and in your life as well.
I dint expect at first that so many health measures are to be taken for a trek. Its India Hikes professionalisms that made sure our health was upto the mark for the trek.
For me the trek was amazing, thrilling and fun. Everything about seemed perfect and Hats off to the entire team of India Hikes . Our TL Himanshu Singla was great fun and professional as well and made sure completed our trek with utmost safety and also enjoy ourselves thoroughly.

His people management skills are exceptional and it’s a lesson for corporates to learn from him how he manages people and situations. He is like a young bishmah pitamah - knows his stuff, matured decision making skills and professionally very high ethics! Javed the trek guide and Baldev the support king were masters and a fantastic combination with gurudit. The local staff were so warm and helpful and made this trek extremely memorable. I do suggest that apart from 5 km run you also add 100 squats everyday before people register.

The trek to Beas Kund taught some much-needed discipline.  The calm and peace of mountains is a much-needed break in our extremely hectic city lives. So whatever peace and calm I was able to learn and bring back in those 4 days were a much-needed lesson.My trek to Beas Kund was an amazing experience that was made possible by our extremely helpful trek leader (Mr. Areeb Parvez) and the local guides. It was a very nice experience right from the booking of the trek until we reached back to Solang valley after 4 days of trekking. The continuous emails that provided information us with precautions, dos, and don'ts and how to prepare for the trek. The mandatory health check-ups are a great initiative by India hikes, that ensured the trekkers were healthy enough to complete the high altitude trek.
Trekking with India Hikes was a good experience. I would highly recommend this company to my friends and would also like to go with them again.
There were a lot of fun activities that our trek leader conducted from games (like dumb-charades and mafia) to just a minute of silence to take in the serenity of the summit (beas kund).
Among all these, it's hard to just pick one as it was an enjoyable experience playing all these games with an amazing group of people. The 2-3 minutes of silence to take in the beauty of the Beas Kund summit was the most serene experience of the 4-day trek.
The concept of green trails made my trekking experience even more enjoyable. The idea of picking up the trash that we find on trails and campsite and the no trace policy by cleaning the campsites helps make the mountains cleaner and peaceful for all the treks.
The concept of cleaning the environment ourselves instead of cribbing about the trash is something that we need to accommodate in our lives.

I think the serenity and peace you experience amidst the mountains gives you a deeper insight of yourself because that is when you’re with only your thoughts. It detoxifies you and reminds of who you really are. The trek itself was wonderful. Not only was the journey breathtaking but it was managed efficiently and effectively. The sense of exhaustion that we think we might feel wasn’t something that weighed down on us. The safety standards were definitely kept in mind. We were well informed about the attire we were meant to carry in order to shield us from rain and cold. The physical well being was also taken into account which was great. All in all it was thoughtfully planned and executed. The fitness criteria is important as it enables you to enjoy the trek because if we’re not fit enough we would be exhausted and wouldn’t be able to enjoy the beauty of the environment.

Indiahikes is a very great trekking community and I really respect the initiatives taken by Indiahikes on all treks. I respect the way Indiahikes is contributing towards maintaining ecological balance, greenery and cleanliness of mountains and nature. Small things like creating awareness on not using wet wipes, packaged foods and which can contribute to waste in mountains help a lot if each trekker follows it. Green trail initiative is a great concept and effort taken by Indiahikes for keeping mountains clean.
Trek was a wonderful experience. Scenic beauty, breathtaking meadows and snowcapped mountains were awesome. Trek leaders and local guides were very cooperative. Food at Jhonkar Thatch was very tasty. The most amazing thing is the black tea served 😊 in the morning which kick started the day. I would also like t highlight on what could have been better:
1.    Rented Trekking Gear: First of all, I rented trek gear and the shoes ordered was 4.5 however I was given 5 which was uncomfortable for me. I paid 690/INR only for the shoe which was maximum amount of all other trek equipment is rented and hence was expecting this to be much better quality.
2.    Trek Co-ordination and Management: The trek co-ordination could have been much efficient, prompt and economical if below proactive initiatives were taken:
a.    WhatsApp group could have been created at least one month in advance to help connect with trek coordinator/ trek leader for any queries as maximum folks were first time trekkers.
b.    WhatsApp group had initially only 6 participants added (however there were total 19 participants in the 15h Jun Batch of Bhrigu Lake). If all participants were added immediately it could have saved money (for flight and bus commute from Delhi/ Chandigarh to Manali) as people living in same cities would have connected with each other at an early stage and planned their travel together. There were almost 6-7 folks from Mumbai who travelled. Since I was solo traveler, and it was my first trek this was really really very crucial for me.
c.    As per my opinion, Bhrigu lake should be categorized under ‘Moderate to difficult’ trek in months which will have SNOW. However, it is listed as ‘Moderate’. I had no clue that we have to slide down in snow 😊 while returning back. Snow walking in daytime is not easy especially on steep slopes as snow melts in daytime plus the altitude sickness makes it more difficult. There should be some informative videos on these on the website against each trek so that people can decide which trek is best for ten as per their risk-taking capability/ health and mental readiness.

Trek leader Leo ensured our health is of top priority. The regular pulse check, updating heal cards and their availability for folks to discuss any symptoms is amazing. He used to conduct warm up exercises before we started the trek and stretch exercises after we completed the day's trek, which would help us a lot. The safety was also taken care of because we rappelled down the ice wall on buran pass and the harness and rope technique was very safe.

The core values you guys follow in the mountains are admiring and really necessary.
The fitness levels you require are according to me are necessary as being unfit it's not so enjoyable for the trekkers as well. This was my first trekking experience with India hikes as well as my first high altitude trek and what I realized that even though I completed my trek but I need to be fitter to enjoy the trek at the fullest.
Secondly, the green trail program that you guys follow in the mountains is really admirable. We as  trekkers and nature lovers want to preserve everything that nature has to offer us. Your green trail program gives every single trekker the opportunity to be a better human of this earth.
The India hikes team was really professional and supportive at the same time. The green trail program of India hikes provided us the opportunity to contribute for the betterment of trekking in India and most importantly the food was unexpectedly very delicious as well as healthy. Just perfect for the weather and trekking.

Hi,
I thoroughly enjoyed the Beas kund trek .kudos to you and  Pranav for organising the trek well.
 Spending 4 days at mountains was a surreal moment for me to reflect on and get basked in nature completely and being oblivious of everything around me .
Learnt that discipline and punctuality are of utmost importance in mountains as weather is always unpredictable here.Same quality is trait of most Noble and successful people 
Cautious steps taken during trek to ensure v don't slip ,though v always had support of our guides , trek leader or commuters during unsure moments need to be exercised in all our important moments of our life .
Even highest achiever and influential person in life is made to feel tiny and aware of his  reality of being just a speck in front of gigantic mountains - good lesson of modesty 
If even with limited resources we could be happy in nature's lap , we tend to be so uncontent in the materialistic world and constantly keep cribbing for more and yet are not really happy always 🤔
Also v can never get fresh air in cities we live in making it even imperative that v spend few days in mountains at least once /twice a year .
Fitness check is well appreciated , made me realize my standing inspite of being regular gym goer and occasional marathon runner 
Made me realise that it's essentail to push myself harder to enjoy future treks better 
Green trails is wonderful initiative ,wish this could be extrapolated to cities and villages as well to make our India clean 
Made us a even more responsible citizen

Buran Ghati was my first trek, ever. Yes, I know - this dodo straight up went to 15,000ft with no prior experience. But with full determination. 
Being a first, I was definitely impressionable, and looking for a benchmark to set up. Boy, did the IH team set up that benchmark REALLY high! They say nothing compares to your first trek, and I can naively say nothing will match up to my first but the biggest contributor to my gala of time being India Hikes. 
Talking to few other experienced trekkers who have dipped their toes in other companies, told me why they always come back to choose IH - safety, security, community belongingness, experience, sanitation, technical advancement etc. rates IH at the top of everyone’s list. 
To add, I had been blessed by a team of the most amazing trekkers with me. I know this is out of the hands of IH but quality attracts quality and but the prestige of IH not only reflected in the members of their own team, but the trekkers too.

Importance of fitness cannot be overemphasized. Situations can change quickly that demand higher fitness levels. At the same time, participants esp those over 40 often have their own challenges that need to be discussed and placed in the perspective of whether they might come in the way.

From the co-trekkers to the local staff, I am grateful for every being present there. The trek wouldn’t have been half as great without the company.

As said by Izzat Yaganagi, Buran Ghati is truely a bridge between 2 world. There was not a single moment when I felt bored, and specially the forest section. I have never seen such beautiful forest section in any of treks.
The campsites are perfect with the grand mountains towering infront of us, perhaps the prettiest Dayara Meadows, perfect camping at Litham were truely the highlights of the trek.
Mountains does teach us a lot of things and learnt a lot. For me the most beautiful moment was when I got to know Gurkirit was my Trek Leader as I have trekked with him earlier and I cannot ask for more as he is the best Trek Leader with great communication skills and friendly nature.

He is a complete package of entertainment, knowledge and motivation. I guess he has that charismatic qualities which our required .
We couldn't ask for a better trek leader.
The kind of spirit and determination he had pumped us all.
In the meantime while not trekking he is a very interesting person to chat and discuss about a lot of things.
I would say he is really knowledgeable and understands to have a good conversation.
He taught us many games and was open to play our games . Always used to be the energetic one while playing.
We played football at dayara and even at litham when the campsite was completely covered in snow.

Origin of River Bhadirathi and Tapovan was like we were in heaven. We were disappointed initially when you said that Tapovan is not possible due to heavy snow in that region. Thanks to Karan Singh (trek leader) and Baldev-Rana (local guides) for completing our trek successfully. Baldev was very active and quick to handle all situations especially in Gaumukh to Tapovan trek and back which was little risky, scary.

We become like Life members of IH. I prefer IH mainly for the Safety at high altitude which is very important. I feel peace of mind when I do trekking with IH that if anything goes wrong, IH will handle and take us all safely. 2nd thing is location of campsites. I noticed IH's campsite locations are at amazing places with great views and easy availability of water sources which is also very important. Food part which is also important at high altitude is always wonderful with IH

Green trails part of IH is also very appreciable. Providing Eco bag on first day and collecting waste from trails and lastly dumping in different bags is really very good job you encourage to trekkers.

Pralad taught us a few local dance moves which again was very fun. He also introduced us to a kind of warm up dance called zikuza which was one of the highlights of the trek. Pralad also told us many interesting and scary stories about  the campsites which were amazing.

The mountains taught me to adapt to my surroundings.

It taught me to appreciate that there are forces in work that are much larger than us and we must be grateful for any kind of resources we utilise. Apart from this, the trek also taught me to believe in myself and not give up when faced with adversity.

1. We need to proactively, consistently engage in any effort to clean up mountains

3. Water is not unlimited, we should limit its use
Generally time spent on the trek helps me appreciate the things we have rather than the ones we dont.

Due to my past ill experience with some other trekking group, I was very tense and nervous at the very start. But since the website had all the information laid out crystal clear, I think it prepared me well. I really like the way your website is designed. And all the nervousness eased out when I met the team at Sankari. 
Our Trek leader Meghna and our guides Santosh and Amin were helpful and supportive to each one of us at every step. It was evident that every person working there got joy out of it. And I cant appreciate the camp / kitchen staff enough for all the hard work they do in such tough conditions to make our experience a good one. 
Absolutely loved the hot fresh food that was always served with love. They even got a gajar halwa cake for my birthday at 8,200 ft. It was surreal. This trek was a birthday gift I got for myself and I think I am going to make it a tradition now. The only downside remains that we could not reach the summit due to weather conditions. Hopefully, I will find myself up there the next time.

When one travels in the mountains like a tourist, passing by in the comfort of a car or living in a hotel room, the experience is limited to views to die for. The real sense of the majestic scale of mountains can only be experienced by something like this trek..I felt overwhelmed and exhilarated. the challenges we faced up in the mountains made us all come together like a family. 
more importantly, the interaction with the camp staff and even some locals was very thought provoking.. it gave an insight into the everyday life of people who stay up in the mountains with limited resources without a hint of grievance. It really made me appreciate the little things that we take for granted back home. There is still alot more I have to learn from the mountains so will keep going back. fingers crossed...

There were three reasons why I choose to do this trek. 
The first one being my birthday. Every year I complain about how I never enjoy my birthday and I'm forced by peer pressure into those noisy bars , getting fully wasted and not remembering any of it. This year I choose to do something different, something for myself.  
The second reason was an escape from everything that I hate about the city . 
The third was that I had never experienced snow before. (yes I have seen snow but never snowfall and those white blindly landscapes  you only see on desktop screen savers) So I had to pick Kedarkantha for that reason. I was also told by a fellow trekker on another trek that I did that the descend down from the summit was an exhilarating slide down the snow so it made my decision even easier. 
Did this trek live up to all my expectations ? .... More than I ever imagined! 
My first solo trip devoid of all connectivity to my social life, 12 hours away from what I understand as urbanization with 20 absolute strangers which lead to a whole bunch of apprehension. Though it all quickly vaporised , probably in the first couple of hours of meeting everyone. We got along like butter and jam , and the next couple of days our crew trekked together as a family.  Obviously this had a lot to do with the people that helped us get there, the organisers , you guys. 
Our trek leader, Deep, so friendly and easy going, we initially presumed he was part of the group. Fun was his agenda and he always made sure that everyone was having it besides all the arduous tasks of being a trek leader. 
The guides were patient and understood everyone's stamina and capacity. They were happy to make a conversation, always telling us more about the mountains.
The staff was efficient, and never tardy. The food was exactly what we craved to eat and not to mention ""my birthday cake"" ... damn that was a good carrot cake. ( made it really special) . 
So to summarise, I came with the expectation of a quiet birthday in the solitude of the mountains but I left with 20 new friends, great conversations, new perspectives and all the while being awestruck and encapsulated by the beauty of the mountains. 
It's going to be hard to match up to my birthday next year.

The one thing that I take back from the mountains is the sense of consciousness that it leaves you with. Be it about the environment , your own body or mind. 
It makes you aware of all the little things we take for granted in are consumer-driven lifestyle and the impacts it has on nature and our surroundings; be it buying a plastic bottled water or how we dispose our trash or the amount of things we consume which are packaged in plastic and other non bio degradable things. Where does all of it eventually end up? It's sad that we are the only species that can't contribute positively back to nature. Even the bare little traces of ourselves that we leave in the mountains makes you reflect on our everyday lifestyles. 
The act of climbing itself engages both body and mind, you learn your own limitations , your weaknesses and your resilience to reach a goal . All these qualities manifest themselves when you face the magnitude of the mountains. 
I gained a sense of spirituality being a not so spiritual person.

One change which is I would strongly recommend is about the food for the staff were often getting finished. Since the trekkers don't get to know how much food is left, crew members often go hungry as they take food after the trekkers. Please ensure that crew members receive complete diet along with the trekkers.

On the trek, everything was well planned from lemon tea, to nutritious snacks/breakfast, to warm-up routines and constant tips from the Guides Rana and Subhash helped us ascend easily.
The tents were very clean and good to camp. The Evening snacks and games in the evening along with innumerable photoshoots gave us some lifelong memories and the desire to come back for more.

This was my 2nd experience with Indiahikes and the best one as well. Everything was just perfect..the trek leaders, the staff, trek mates, climatic conditions and everything else were totally outstanding. The trek leader Mihir is one of the most humble and fun people. He made the trek a satisfying one.

Trek was amazing even though it was cut short just after a day of trekking.
The trek leader had looked after our safety and well being very well.
Many thanks!
I also wanted to commend on Ajay (Transport coordinator) great work.
I need to arrange transport from Sankri to Raithal for another trek.
It wasn't as straight forward as there were multiple cancellations and rebookings due to weather changes in those area. Nonetheless, Ajay was there to assist me all the way.
Many thanks again.

So there are times during the trek when you start feeling grateful of the small things that you have back in the city but do not really value much- something as basic as sanitation. Also, when you have no network for 7 days, is when you make the most amazing friends and most amazing memories. I'm so glad that I went for this trek. It's been a week today but the hangover is still at it's peak!

The trek was fantastic. The trail was beautiful. The views were magnificent.
The major contributing factor to this was the new trail by the Indiahikes team. We all loved it.
Our trek leader Guru and trek guides Dev and Sanju were superb.
Guru made sure everything(regarding high altitude) was explained thoroughly to all of us in a light-hearted manner. I also loved the warm-up activities and the games conducted by him.
Dev's words of encouragement echoing in the mountains I will simply never forget. The energy he brought into the team was outstanding. He shared a lot of stories too during dinner time.
Sanju was there right at the end of the group during the trek, making sure everyone reached the campsite safe and sound. One of my friends who was at the end of the group heard him singing and enjoyed it. I missed it though.
These 3 folks are fun to be around and I'd be more than happy to go with them for next treks.
The food served during the trek was delicious. It was too good. The best one was the gajar halwa cake on my birthday. Kudos to the kitchen staff for making such delicious food, those guys truly deserve a raise.
Although we couldn't make the summit because of heavy snowfall, I had an amazing time and I'm sure everyone shares the same feeling.
I made new friends on this trek and hopefully we will be coming back to see what nature looks like from 12500ft.

This was the first time I went on a high altitude trek and it certainly did teach me a lot of things. Our trek leader Guru taught us the importance of waste management and how to segregate waste.
The other thing that I learnt is to be grateful. I'm at my home right now and on a flip of a switch, I get hot water... on the mountains, it takes time and effort to fill one bucket. I realised this when I was brushing my teeth one morning with ice cold water. Good fun.

Kudos to the entire team at Indiahikes, both the on-ground team and the people back at the office sending us detailed emails about every little aspect of the trek preparation. This was my first official Himalayan trek and I am so glad I chose to do it with Indiahikes!
Our trek leaders Samkit, Prahlad and Labbu bhaiyya were the best combination of people ever; strict, professional but fun-loving and enthusiastic in the right amounts! They were all extremely encouraging, supportive and cared for each of us. I was travelling all by myself and never once did I feel alone; It literally felt like a family away from home!

I was preparing well for the trek but sadly I met with an accident, just a month before my trek. So I was under heavy medication. Antibiotics three times a day for four weeks and I did not get rid of those side effects. I really felt so bad to be the last before one in the group. I will definitely do this trek again with full energy mode.
I don't even have a single negative thing to pin point or give a comment. Everything was so well organized and executed. Right from the ECO bag, waste disposal, food to post trek warm ups.

I am at a loss of words to express what a wonderful experience it has been. I remember the morning we met all our trek mates and I was extremely happy to see everyone be so humble, full of life and enthusiastic. Then came the time we met our trek leaders and their friendly approach towards us was something that got us comfortable as a whole group in no time. Praladh, Samkit and Labhu have been extremely supportive and had gone out of their way to make us feel comfortable. One of our trek leaders, Praladh made us play some games to break the ice on day one of our trek which was one of the main reasons we all got to know each and everyone who had joined in for this trek even better. Our mid night group jamming sessions and stories are always going to remain very close to my heart. The support and encouragement each and everyone has shown, was commendable, which is also probably why we were all able to achieve the goal of climbing the summit before sunrise.

Each and every activity. Trek leaders cared much about our batch collaboration.

Samhith and Prahalad was so helpful and they both helped us to cross the slippery pace, like a father. We all fell down atleast once while walking on those frozen ice, even the trek leaders but these two guys were so amazing. Each and every step we take were completely under their guidance. They shared their trek experiences, about the places we pass by, pine forests, and on summit day, Prahalad was constantly motivating me to move up and see the sunrise from the summit but sadly I saw it few meters below the summit. He explained about the surrounding himalayan ranges.
Laboo was protecting us from the back, he was the last one in our group. He waited patiently till we take enough pictures whenever we stop by any beautiful scenaries.
Santosh helped us on summit day, he carved us steps on the snow and he as a leader lead the team on summit day.
Samhith and Prahalad made us to interact with the other people by conducting games, throwing snow at each other, dishkoom game, snow war, imaginary volley ball. I'm an introvert, I never thought I would talk with these many people but these guys made it happen. Please convey my gratitude to these guys, missing them a lot now.

I believe this trek has re-taught me the value of Humility in a big way. When you are stripped of all your urban add-ons and are forced to live almost like an animal, you realize where the definition of privilege actually starts! This made me feel very humbled and grateful for the life I have been blessed with back at home. 
Secondly, I realized how the mountains remind you that irrespective of your degrees and titles back in your city life, you are essentially an insignificant dot in the universe; this trek made me give up whatever little inflated ego I might have had!
Finally, I realized that anything that you feel is beyond your capabilities is still ENTIRELY POSSIBLE if you have an iron will. It is all about mental fortitude and resilience. I think the mountains and the steep upward climbs on this trek were pretty much a metaphor for life itself; this trek has given me new hope and made me realize that my problems are not bigger than my ability to overcome them!

Trek experience was more like a summary of life in compressed form. 
It teaches us that life/trek has no obligations to go as per our plans/wishes. i.e. execution of trek/life will not get adapted/adjusted to an individual preference rather individuals will have to be adapt quickly to the need of the hour by challenging one's own habits, preferences, comfort zones & physical & mental conditioning. At the end its all about being completely in present, trying to make most of the existing situations and be happy in the moment without worrying too much about the past or future (an ability we have completely lost leading busy city lives).

The stillness, yet the strength of the mountains is unbelievable. As I reached the summit, all the effort and tough times I went through while climbing was just forgotten. Living around nature is like you have entered a whole new world, the snow glittering in the moonlight and then shining in the sunlight adds on to the experience all together. I definitely take some wonderful memories back home from my first himalayan trek and it wasn't only the mountains that I learnt from but also the people who joined along, everyone being so humble and supportive.

The beauty of a trek such as ours does not lie only in the beautiful landscapes and  the mind-boggling views but also in quite a lot of other things hidden from the naked eye. If given thought you might realise these things . As far as what I saw it made me realize the importance of a helping and all time active attitude towards everything doesn't matter how important it might be. The more active the mind the stronger is the body and the more helpful the nature the greater is the reception. All good deeds are appreciated though in the long run but definitely someday sometime .

Kudos to India Hikes team Suhas, Madhu, Pragya, Chaman and Subhash for coordinating this trek. India Hikes does a great job of providing all the information and everything was well communicated and organized.  
I was trekking with such a big group after almost 10 years so it was a bit of a challenge for me. Most of the people on the trek were young so at times it was a bit loud for me. There were very few moments of true silence on the trek which made it difficult to hear the sounds of nature - birds, streams, etc. I have been the young and loud person at some time so I understand, it's just that at this stage in life I prefer to have a quiet time in the mountains.

Mountains test you as an individual and has the ability to bring the worst / best in you. I spent almost a week in the mountains with a close friend and it really tested our friendship. There were times when we didn't agree on things and would have preferred to have it our own way, but we made it through and probably came out stronger as individuals as well as friends. 
For me this trek with a big group just highlights the need to recognize that we are all different and yet want to achieve the same goal. Connecting with individuals and leveraging each others strengths is the key to success in a big group.

And one thing Indiahikes have to change is their emailing system. Because the guidance  and information given through email is really don't followed by everyone because there are many peoples who do not check their mails daily. so for that i have suggestion of make """"Application of Indiahikes"""" this is the best option for information training guidance details and everything. Because normally peoples check their apps daily like whatsapp or instagram.

And the humility that comes from being in the midst of the mountains and the local dwellers, who show such kindness and consideration towards all the trekkers who temporarily visit their village and terrain. 
I wasn't able to finish the trek, in fact I had to turn back less than halfway, because I made certain mistakes in my choice of clothing. But the stay back in Panthwari, at the house of the local guide Surinder bhaiya, was very productive. This was arranged by our trek leader Ashish and the hostess was very warm and welcoming, and made me feel very much at home. I was regaled with trek stories, roamed the countryside and also took part in a traditional dholak festival. Although it turned out to be very different from what I had expected, it was an enriching experience and I look forward to doing the Nag Tibba trek with Indiahikes again in January, this time successfully.
Our trek leader instructed us on the dos and don'ts and was very precise and professional on all points. The safety standards of Indiahikes is really top notch in my opinion, and this is something I researched extensively before choosing Indiahikes. It can only get better from here on out. And the Green trails and Eco bags initiative is a big, big thumbs up and an absolute need of the hour.

On the 1st day when we reached Sankri, right when we were getting down out of our vehicles, Tanmay was there to shake hands and greet us. I never realized it before this that such a small gesture could ever have such a big leverage in making me feel welcomed and safe.Tanmay's method of instruction were very practical and theoretical. He always explained the rationale behind every small task or instruction. This helped me gain a lot of clarity in terms of what is expected from of me and why. Tanmay always went out of the way to tell us about things remotely related to the trek like, fitness tips, attitude towards trek and trekmates, how to care for trekking gear, how to tie shoe laces and use a high ankle shoes like loafers, etc. The trek was very high endurance for me as I never achieved my fitness goals. Ofcourse Tanmay recognized it immediately looking at my pace. However, he never discouraged me or made me feel insecure. He was always there for me to boast me up. On the day of the summit, he made a sequence and made me lead the team of 15 members. All of them were behind me trailing the hike. Because he made me hike in the beginning of the sequence, I could push myself for the summit in the given time. Or else I would have either given up long before summit or would never have reached the summit before time. So I dont know if all trek leaders follow a sequence and keep low performers at the beginning or not, but the only reason why I could make it to the summit in time was because Tanmay worked miracle with the sequence and put me 1st on it. When I reached the summit, again he was there to greet and congratulate me on reaching the summit. I loved everything about the trek. The part of certificate distribution on the last day took me totally by surprise because Indiahikes made sure by way of the certificate distribution that we believe and celebrate that, making to the summit was an achievement after all. To make it more memorable, Tanmay remembered each and every person's traits that he noticed from the whole trek and made an introductory welcome speech for each and every person before awarding the certificate. I was very touched by all the description be gave about me because it was all very true and spot on.
Tanmay was a motivator.

We also got to see Mt Everest, Lhotse & Makalu, but maybe for like half a minute, it was indeed a great feeling to stand there and view these majestic mountains. We had a great trek leader(Venkat), we did get to know and learn a lot from him about the mountains, the risks on mountains, all the precautions that need to be taken when on the mountains and he also shared with us a lot of his stories and experiences during his treks which definitely led us to a better understanding of how the various situations on treks could be dealt with.

Being a local guy Dev, the trek leader made the right decision to descend from the second base after analyzing the situation and experience of the trekkers.To summarize even though we could not make the ridge because of uncontrollable reasons but I had a good learning from my first trek.

The best part was again the local guides and the trek leader.Being local people they knew the place inside out and made the trek interesting with their local folklore which wouldn't have been possible had these people been outsiders.

About the actual trek I loved every part of it. I never expected that I will get to experience so many new things in this trek, be it playing mafia or football in the high altitudes, or learning how to pitch tents. or eating chow mein at 12,000 ft. 
The views, the trail, the teahouses, and the people. The entire trek was done in a smooth fashion and there were no hiccups. Indiahikes team have done a brilliant job in organizing and this trek has definitely sparked the mountain lover in me.

The trek went really good! This was my first trek ever and that too a solo one at that but the team was just so helpful and welcoming that it felt as if I have been there a thousand times before. The food was excellent and highly nutritious and that was just what we needed after trekking all day. 

 There is absolutely nothing I would like to change about the trek. This trek made me realize what I have been missing and is sure to be the first of many treks I am gonna do with Indiahikes.

About cook & foods:  Ankur Bhai and Munna Bhai provide us the all the awesome tasty foods even in that high altitude. I really amazed by these kinds of facilities.
About Staff members:  Apart from our trek leaders and cooks all other staffs stayed there in the camp site are also very kind and good people.   
Last but not the least I really appreciate the efforts of the Indiahikes management team for all the facilities and the information they provide us for the planning and successful accomplishment of this trek.

The safety standards were adequate and properly carried out.

At such high altitude also you never missed to give us a dessert along with each meal. It was a really beautiful trek and the view from the summit was really awesome. We could see everything..forest, river, mountains, Himalayan peaks, meadows,  birds, wildlife and even snowfall. Group was awesome and have made some good friends and would really like to come again for the trek.

Overall Trek went very well. It is very well planned and executed. All India Hikes team is really very good team with friend and caring all the time!
One biggest feedback is, For some reason most of the day team tries to rush us to reach the destination of that day. It would be great if we reduce that rush and have the trek team enjoy the trekking all day with stops to enjoy the nature and surroundings.
Somedays we reach destination at 2 or 3 and then nothing to do except sit int he tent and play some games. I am sure trekkers have not come that far to play games in the tent, rather enjoy the nature with little rush during the trekking would have been great.

The Goechala trek was an amazing experience for me. It was my first trek of that type and first visit to the Himalayas. The scenery was spectacular and we were very lucky to have good weather for the whole trek. 
I was very impressed with the organisation of the trek - the initial briefing, the welcome dinner and the way that the trek leader Bupenda kept us informed of all plans throughout the trek. I thought the itinerary was well planned and enabled time for acclimatisation and for appropriate balance of effort over the 10 days (i.e. alternate shorter and longer days walking).
I would like to make special mention of Bupi as I think his leadership and quiet authority was a key reason the trek went so well. He has an excellent ability to bring a group together and to listen to individuals and help them as required as well as keep everyone motivated. He was also very well supported by Mingu who was extremely conscientious and attentive and looked after all us trekkers so well while at the same time helped organise the kitchen staff and porters etc. Both Mingu and Bupi also have great patience which can only be admired. I am also especially grateful for the lovely efforts that the whole Indiahikes team made to help celebrate Jim’s birthday. I know he was very touched by all the birthday wishes and the cake was amazing! 
Speaking of food it was excellent for the whole trip. The kitchen staff are remarkable in the what they can produce. I always felt very well fed!

The trek was really awesome. 
We visited two lakes called Lakshmi Pokhri and Neel Pokhri on the rest day at Dzongri and before heading from Thansing to Lamuney. These two lakes were really beautiful and I believe that these should be included in the itinerary too. Our trek leader Bhupen was pro active and super organized all through the trek. His travel stories were super inspiring to listen to and his passion for the mountains clearly stands out when he strikes a conversation with you. Bhupen also had a lot of entertaining games and warm-ups up his sleeves that made it more fun for us while on the trek. The local guides, Mingo and Dhonbir were super caring and helpful as well. Major kudos to the kitchen staff who brave the cold and prepare luxurious food for us at various altitudes. The regular updates from Prathima was also helpful in knowing what to expect while on the trek. This is my fourth trek with Indiahikes and I'm really really impressed at how the organizing is top notch each time.

His warm up activities like Jacuzza, Penguin dance, Scott claps, sum sum rum sum sum were super entertaining and helpful in warming up and keeping the cold at bay. The best, however, was the trek anthem that Bhupen taught us and we sang it each day and for every occasion on the trek

And mostly, I'm thankful to Himanshu and the rest of the team who were absolutely amazing and made this adventure so special, thanks to their professionalism, their kindness, their stories, their friendship and everything you could ask for.
Here are a few suggestions that I can think of to make this experience even more amazing (they didn't have a negative impact on my experience in any way though):
- We are fed a LOT - between the breakfast, tea time, lunch, tea time #2, soup and dinner, I feel like I spent the most part of the trek eating, even when I wasn't hungry. The food was really delicious but I would skip some of it so we can really appreciate the meals (like the morning and afternoon biscuits).

My overall experience was so rewarding. This was a trek to find our inner peace. I am really happy and excited with the honest relationship that I now have with myself.  
P.S.- Only sad part of the trek was, touristy people could reach the same height in their cars and could see the same views. For me, Trek has always meant to be something that others cannot reach until they put an effort to walk.

642,Atish Banerjee,2018-10-01,Phulara Ridge,"
Loved every moment! The drive to Sankri was gorgeous, driving along the river and through alpine forests was a treat. Sankri is a charming little village and the IH base camp was really cozy. The view from the camp was just breathtaking, the sound of the Tons river and the dazzling night sky adding to the ambience.
The trek, under the watchful eye of our guide Sunilji 'Superman' Rawat and our leader, the calm, collected and unshakable Krupa and the formidable, super efficient, master chef staff members, was truly unforgettable. The ascent though exerting, just kept getting better and better. The first camp at Juda ka Talab was a beautiful spot and to learn to pitch a tent was so rewarding. The walking on boulders, through massive alpine forests and vast meadows surely makes you feel humble.
The second camp near Dhunda ridge is one of the, if not the most picturesque places I have visited in my life. Words can't describe the absolute beauty of the sun setting on the meadows!
Then came the morning of mixed emotions, pure ecstasy to see snowfall, turning green to white and the sinking feeling that the ridge walk might be cut short due to bad weather. Nevertheless, after the weather cleared, a section of the ridge walk was done, which was stunning to say the least. The weather had cleared when we came near Pushtara ridge but there wasn't enough time to safely complete the trail. I learnt a valuable lesson, to truly respect the awesome power of nature!
The walk down was punishing (my stupid city bred legs are to blame!) but totally worth it to see India's very own Rivendell (I am not even exaggerating). The forests, the locals and the beauty of them both made the journey sweeter. Descend completed in the evening and spent the night at the coziest of guest houses (Gypsy child) in Soud. Everything was well coordinated and arranged and have no complaints, regrets or issues, none at all! If anything I felt a bit underprepared and hope to be much more prepared for the next trek.

This was my first high altitude trek with Indiahikes and I would say whenever I decide to go to the mountains I will choose Indiahikes only. Starting from the base camp at Sankri till the last day the team took care of us in such a way as if we were members of their family. All the arrangements made by them, starting from food to stay everything was perfect.
Now I would like to highlight a few points about the trek. I never imagined walking through the forest trails can be so beautiful. Although on the first day there was a steep ascent throughout a long stretch, the moment I looked around I was spell-bound and all my tiredness vanished. All the campsites were at perfect places from where we got awesome views of the Garwal Himalayan range. Also since it was a running camp, I got the opportunity to learn how to pitch a tent. And how can I not mention about the Phulara Ridge! The moment we started to walk on the ridge, adrenaline rush flushed through my veins. It might sound a little dramatic but that's the truth. As we were heading to the highest point, the scenery got better and better. Every turn around the corner of the ridge made us feel more alive. It was breathtaking. Last but not least the least the cherry on the cake was the snowfall. And since this was my first experience seeing the snowfall, it was more exciting and beautiful.

This was my first high altitude trek. My 14 year old son and niece accompanied me. My niece, Divya, has done Kedarkantha with you guys a few years back. The trek went as smoothly as I could possibly imagine. 
Day 1 and Day 6: Dehradhun to Sankri and back - The tempos were well organized and very comfortable. We had really good breakfast, lunch and chai on the way. The driver was a sweetheart by stopping at a few picturesque spots so that we could take pictures.  
On reaching Sankri, the accommodation was very well arranged. The rooms were very comfortable and loved their really cozy quilts! The IH team was very helpful and directed us to our rooms and ensured that we had hot hot chai and snacks. The food was very yummy! The briefing was interesting and it was exciting to meet our trek leads. Having read about them on #IHTrekLeaders, I was really looking forward to meeting them. 
Day 2 - Day 5: Trek from Sankri and back - It was an amazing experience for me. We had Vivek, Ravi, Guddu and Arvind with us. The ascents were difficult in that I had to stop every few meters to catch my breath (which made me the last one in the pack). But, never once did any of the IH team make me feel like I was holding the rest of the team up. They were very encouraging and told me I was doing well and was only about 15-20 minutes behind, which was good compared to other teams. The IH team and the trek team were very very supportive on all 3 days of the ascent. The sights were amazing and the camping was so much fun. The tents and sleeping arrangement was very very comfortable. The toilet tents were totally functional as well. The food on all days of the trek was delicious. It was amazing how they were always on time and the food was always yummy. Big big thanks to the food team for everything! The gulab jamun in celebration of our ridge climb was the best way to celebrate! 
Kudos to the entire IH team (operations and back office) for all their effort. I'm so glad to have done this with you guys.

First of all, I would like to thank IndiaHikes team for making this trek wonderful for me. 
This was my first ever Himalayan trek. I was a bit afraid about this 9 days long trek. I was not sure about how IndiaHikes will manage our health, food and safety. But, IndiaHikes team managed everything smoothly and easy. IndiaHikes team was way beyond my expectation. Excellent+Superb+Amazing IndiaHikes. Now about the trek, in one word it was like HEAVEN to me. I was in heaven for 9 days with IndiaHikes and my trek mates. From day 1 itself, They managed out travel and food easily. Those 11 hours of journey in tempo traveller help us to interact with other trek-mates. On the arrival, the beautiful riverside base camp site stole my heart. Then we met our trek leader and trek guides. Trek leader gave us very nice information about the trek and all safety guidelines. From day 2, We were going through crystal clear water river, gigantic mountain and beautiful meadows. There were 2 homestays during out trek. It was luxurious stay and nice facilities. Cooking staff was always ready with hot tea and delicious snacks on our arrival. Throughout the 9 days trek, they were giving us nutritious food everytime tea, breakfast, lunch, hot soup, snacks in the evening, dinner with dessert. They were giving us different dishes all the time, I don't how they were managing this. Everyday new scenery was there for us. During our trek, we faced fresh snowfall at our campsite. It was really an awesome experience for us. On the summit day, It was fully covered with fresh snow everywhere. We have spent a good time with the team. Summit day was the most memorable day for me. I learnt so many things from this trek that helps me a lot in my life.
Overall, full trek nicely handled by the trek leader and two trek guides. Trek guide was the awesome person that I have ever met in my life. Throughout the 9 days, trek leader and trek guides treat us as our second parent. One thing, that I missed here is, before trek preparation guidelines given by our trek co-ordinator. I have been through all the emails and youtube videos provided by the IndiaHikes. Those emails and youtube videos help me a lot throughout the trek.
I am proud to be part of this group.
Thanks a lot, IndiaHikes team for having me in this wonderful journey.
I hope to see you soon :)

It was really a learning experience for me.  To carry my own 14kg backpack gave me nice self-sufficiency type feeling.  Pitching and Un-pitching of tent by our own was tremendous experience.  Above all, carrying Eco Bags was a nice toddler step towards our environment.
      RETURNING 3800/- IS REALLY A SWEET AND NICE GESTURE FROM INDIAHIKES :) :) 
Full marks to Indiahikes on safety, safety gears, and health checkup front.  Even physical fitness criteria is also good and it really helps to prepare for the trek better.

I am grateful to Vishnu for keeping a tab on my fitness regime before going :).  It really helped me to complete the trek efficiently without any leg pain, shoulder pain (as I was carrying my 14kg backpack, thanks to a video by Shweta :) I took it seriously :) and didnt offload it :), and even without taking Diamox.

The trek was an amazing experience!  While the beauty of the mountains is all Mother Nature's work, the thorough planning and smooth execution of your team made the trek through the lovely scenery memorable.  Right from the first time I stumbled on the Indiahikes website, my experience with you has been top-notch.  Be it the detailed documentation of the treks, the smooth registration process, the interactions with the trek coordinator weeks prior to the trek, the rental and purchasing experience from the website, the awesome team of guides on the trek, the equipment and tasty nutritious food provided, everything has been top-notch and extremely professional.
I would specifically like to call out a few people who made my experience truly memorable.  First, Sreelakshmi, our trek coordinator, who effectively and patiently guided us through our preparation for the trek.  I especially liked the idea of the WhatsApp group for the trek; that really helped us get to know each other before the trek and bond a lot better during the trek itself.  The e-mails, WhatsApp posts and one-on-one clarifications from her leading up to the trek really helped me in my preparations and I would like to sincerely thank her for that.
Next, the team of guides on the trek: our trek leader Himanshu and the guides Buddha-ji and Gopal-da.  What an awesome team!  Himanshu is an excellent trek leader and a true ambassador of the mountains and India Hikes.  His incredible knowledge about all aspects of the mountains, the flora and fauna was enriching and his anecdotes were both entertaining and instructive.  His sessions at the tea-houses in the evenings went a long way in getting the group to gel and be more comfortable with one another and his creative games at the end of each day were very enjoyable.  His offer to carry my water and packed lunch on the trek to Phalut was a personal morale booster for me.  I am ever grateful for that and will never forget it.  Too bad we had to cancel the push to Phalut due to weather.  I could also see that he gave personal attention to each and every trekker keeping their condition in mind and ensuring that they complete the trek safely.  
As for Buddha-ji and Gopal-da, their efforts to make every aspect of the trek go smoothly and safely are commendable.  Here, I must appreciate the patience of Gopal-da which as the sweeper guide was tested by a few of us moving slowly and stopping every now and then for photographs :-)  A big thanks to each and every one of them for their thoughtful

When we arrived it was green grass and many waterfalls and flowing river. On Acclimatization Day, it was completely covered in snow and a completely different and wonderful to look at and enjoy.
2. Kitchen Staff: The kitchen staff was amazing. The variety of food we got to eat and the deliciousness of it was as pleasing as the landscaped we were crossing. A complete delight. It will take me a long time to forget the taste of the hot Samosa that we ate once we arrived in Udaknal. Truly amazing.
3. Guide and Co-Guide: Uttam and Pravin were exceptional and had a great attitude. They were always ready to help. Shared their stories and had fun all along. Pravin had the hard task of being the sweeper and did it patiently. Uttam helped me on more than one occasion when I had issues with equipment.

My experience with IH for EBC Gokro Ri was incredible and simply flawless. 
Firstly the trek was superbly planned and managed by your team. The local guides (Tula Ji and Deewani Ji) were amazing people. Our trek guide (Yash Choudhari) was very good, experienced and knowledgable. Guides and the trek leader together handled the trek in an extraordinary manner. The trek days and acclimatisation days were well planned as well. The accommodations at Tea houses was a nice experience, and the stay on all the days was very comfortable with nice food each day. The trek group was also full of amazing people, with great experiences of their own.
Doing the EBC Trek from the Gokyo side was a very pristine experience. The crowds of trekkers were very less compared to the Classic EBC route which made the experience better. And the views from Gokyo Ri of Mt Everest and Lhotse were better and clear. Thanks to the IndiaHikes' pre-requisite for Trekker fitness, it helped a lot, as every member of the team was fit and fine throughout the trek, and all of us making it to Gokyo Ri, Chola pass, Everest Base Camp as well as Kala Patthar. To describe the mesmerising views of the snow caped peaks, massifs, valleys, flora & fauna, etc which we saw would be difficult, but each moment felt like the most beautiful moment of the life, and a moment to cherish lifelong. Everest, Kumbhu Ice Fall, Nuptse, Lhotse, Lobuche, Cho Oyu, Makalu, Ama Dablam and our trek group will be engraved in my memories forever.
I look forward to doing more treks with IH in years to come.

Special kudos the trek leader Himanshu Thapa. He made sure that everyone in the team was comfortable. He communicated well with the team, checking every ones oxymeter  reading every day in the morning and evening, providing the info regarding trek route before the start on each day. This helped the team a lot. He also made sure that no one was left behind and would keep talking and encouraging each member of the team.
Apart from Himanshu, the Trek guide (DB Daa) and Sweeper guide (Peter Bhai) were equally helpful. They ensure that everyone was enjoying the trek and kept talking to the team, explaining them about the local weather, flora and fauna. Overall, it was a great experience.

The Trek has been amazing. The beauty and tranquility of the Himalayas bewildered me from the very moment I stepped on the Jaubari.Our trek leader and guides were extremely courteous and they managed it really well. Our team was full with positive vibes. Every other person had their own kind of amazing stories. Last but not the least, it was all about nature itself. From rustic valleys to Buddhist Stupa, from pasture and Meadows to deep Forest, from gushing streams to omnipresent Kanchenjhunga - It was a slice of memory that I will Cherish Forever. Kudos to Indiahikes for this wonderful trek.

Over all I liked the trek experience.  I am a first time trekker. Karan did a good job. 
Pathan & Deepu were of great help on the tapovan day since the path was very dangerous.
Regarding the kitchen team . Food was good. They were using a lot of sugar in all the hot beverages that they were preparing. I was finding it difficult to drink. I had suggested them to keep the sugar separate for people to mix. But they were failing to do the same.
There could have been hot soups every day. Packed lunch was rice on two different days. Rice was extremly cold due  to the weather conditions there. My suggestion is to avoid rice & give  rolls or sandwiches for packed food.

Overall, it was a wonderful experience. This was my first trek ever, my basic reason  on going for a trek was to get away from the daily hustle and bustle in the city. Rains put a dent on the begining  of the trek when we were diverted to sankri but that gave all of us in the group to get to know each other a little better.
Our Trek Leader Akhil was very well versed with the mountains and he ensured that each one of us was briefed on high altitude related health issues, and the precautions which need to be taken.
He was vigilant about the any issues that were reported and he also made sure to took the oxymeter/BP readings everyday all throughout .
Both our guides Jairam and Praveen should be given due credit as the trek would not have been possible without either of them. Jairam would lead the trek and Praveen would be patient with people in the back walking slowly.

We couldn't go to Hampta Pass due to bad weather, but the 3 days of trek gave us infinite memories which will stay with us forever.
Out Trek Leader Gurukirit has a great Communication skills and made sure we are fit for trek and encouraged us.

Everything was managed and scheduled meticulously by our trek leader Mr Himanshu Singhla. Nevertheless to mention our heartfelt thanks to the local guides and the kitchen team.

Food was healthy as well as tasty. With all the services I must say we felt like home even in the mountains far away from home.

668,Apoorva Ramnath,2018-09-01,Gaumukh Tapovan,"
I think I need quite some time to list down all the wonderful experiences I had in Himalayas with Indiahikes team. First of all, this was my 1st time experience with the mighty Himalayas as well as Indiahikes.

Initial bookings were taken care by my friends and so we got to interact with Indiahikes team only after reaching the base camp. Though the weather didn't let us do Gaumukh-Tapovan trek, we somehow managed to do ""Dayara-bugyal"" trek successfully.

Yes, it was quite disappointing as nothing went as per our plan, but now I realize that Nature's plans are better than ours. Though it was not a part of the plan, we were destined to explore Gangotri for 1st 3 days.

Later we moved to Raithal from where we started our actual trek. The path didn't seem to be too tough as we were pretty well prepared. The view of the 1st campsite after almost 4.5 hours of trek was truly amazing.

We did a few relaxing exercises and later spent the evening, playing and chit chatting. Next day was the much-awaited summit day. We were all geared up, super excited and all set for it. Started our walk at around 7.20am and touched the dayara-bugyal top at the destined time.

Since the group proved their fitness level  well, our trek lead was highly impressed and encouraged us to go further to the Bakharia top. The 360 degree view of the mighty snow covered mountains of the Himalayan range was absolutely divine.

We even flew our state(Karnataka) flag high at 12500 ft which was the icing on the cake.

We were actually spell bound by the beauty of the mountains. On the way, we did learn names of few peaks and listened to the experiences of our trek lead. The descend started at around 2 and we could all reach back the campsite by 5.20pm, a total of 20 kms trek in 10 hours. Though the descend took lesser time, all the joints seemed to be disjoint. That night we had the most undisturbed sleep.

Next day, further descent took about 3 hours and we reached the guest house from where we started. These are like once in a lifetime kind of experiences that we all had. The concept of dry toilets were new. Staying in tents with friends, trekking without bathing for days were the fun part of it. There are few things about Indiahikes which have to be highly appreciated.

1. The overall experience was simply superb. As I already mentioned, nothing went as per our plan, yet it was a beautiful experience with you, especially for first timers.
2. The cooking team and the local guides there, worked beyond our expectation.
3. Our trek lead, Mr. Himanshu Singla was an amazing person who always gave more than his 100% to drive the entire team up to the top and helped us achieve our dream of ""Climbing the Himalayan mountain"" without any causalties. We are happy and proud to say that none of us had any sort of medical problems and we were all super excited till we came back home.
Thanks a ton to the entire Indiahikes team for making this happen. Looking forward for my Next trek already!

This is my first experience of trekking and I enjoyed it thoroughly..  Undoubtedly the best days of my life.  
Emails from Indiahikes regarding practice,  choosing gears and other basic stuff were really helpful in preparation for the trek and to improve my strength and stamina.  
Hampta pass is exceptionally beautiful route to travel having huge mountains and soothing rivers acompaning us throughout the trek.  
Every camp site is very beautiful and soothing.  Special mention of sheaguru camp site which stole my heart. I never wanted to come back from there!!! 
The local guides hired by Indiahikes are like 'superheros'.  Especialy shyambhai (like hritik roshan of the movie Krish) could climb huge mountains in 3 easy steps.  And pravinbhai would very patiently and polietly push all draggers from the back.  
All 3 trek leaders saumitra,  Fey and Madhu were super supportive and very friendly.  
Food made by Rahul and team was beyond our imagination at that high altitude that too with limited resources.  I was thrilled to see my surprise birthday cake being served there!! 
We had super fun in dining tents playing games and sharing experiences.  Got a huge bunch of new friends. 
I am way too happy to have chosen Indiahikes as my trek partner.  It was much more then expected.  Thank you.  I am definitely coming for many more treks in futue

Thank you, Indiahikes, for such an awesome trek. The trek was wonderfully managed by trek leader, Gaurab Nandi, and the trek guide,
Saurabh Bartwal.

Gaurab also intelligently managed to merge two small trek groups for the glacier walk part - this enabled us to have more trek leaders and technical staff and have a more safe environment for the most difficult part of the trek.

Saurabh was pretty helpful on the difficult terrains and very informative about all the peaks, landscapes, and local culture. The cook with us, Raju bhaiya, was probably the best and we had awesome food. 

Day 5 is Bhojbasa-Tapovan-Bhojbasa - this is extremely impractical in a day and we couldn't complete this in spite of having a fast team. We know Tapovan camping is restricted. Maybe you can consider modifying just this part of the itinerary and make it doable as well as enjoyable.

Unfortunately we couldn't witness rest of the Lakes as we couldn't complete this trek due to safety reasons and it was a right decision not to continue further and I must thank our Trek leader Vignesh to make a good decision in tough times when there was enough pressure on him to continue from many of trekkers.

The high-quality, clean equipment of tents and sleeping bags left nothing to be desired. I really liked the concept of the Ecobags. All these things made the whole hike a wonderful memory. 
I was also very impressed by the trekking preparation and all the safety measures. The regular emails I received before the hike prepared me thoroughly for the hike and increased my joyful anticipation every day. The safety precautions for measuring oxygen content, pulse and blood pressure were impressive. During the tour we had to cross a landslide area - the trek leaders managed this very well and I always felt safe.

The trek went really well, Indiahikes made sure that we had an amazing 6 days in the mountains.
Everything was spot on, our's was a running batch, and the way the trek leads and all the staff went about their job, they should be given a big round of applause.
All the arrangements were spot on.
While our trek lead Krupa made sure that the health of the trekkers were in good condition by continuously monitoring oxygen level, pulse rate, the other two leaders sai pavan and leo lifted up the trek experience.
Leo with his amazing work related to green trails and with a bunch of amazing hobbies kept us motivated and was really fun to spend time with him.
Pavan, well we call him pavan baba was just amazing throughout the trek, his energy, his enthusiasm, his passion towards mountains, the ability to engage with trekkers to have fun and at the same time strike a balance as a trek lead to convey the message bluntly to maintain discipline especially on pass crossing day was just amazing.
I could narrate many incidents where pavan went out of his way, beyond his duty as a trek lead to help the trekkers and also other trek leads.
Pavan's energy and passion are quite contagious, we were lucky to have met him on this trek.
I will remember the name selke sai pavan, I am sure he will reach great heights in his life!
I have saved the best for the last --> Hampta pass trekking trail.
The trail is so beautiful, green valleys, gushing water, Indrasan and deo tibba peaks, beautiful mountains of spiti valley and all the campsites are just amazing.
Kudos to Indiahikes for making this an unforgettable experience in our life, thank you very much!

Indeed a lifetime experience!
Just like to add that the last ascent for Tapovan has become so difficult that we couldn't make it, keeping the time constraint in mind (one has to come back till Bhojbasa since no camping at Tapovan site), because the trail till Tapovan has virtually disappeared because of natural activities. The loose rocks over the glacier and till Tapovan has made the climb treacherous. Better to be safe, we decided not to take the risk. 
Thanks all members in the field for making the trek a success, despite adversities.

Trek went well. I am really thankful to India hikes for planning well and organizing this even for a small team of six.  Every staff in the trek was very helpful , accommodative and helping the trekkers. To start with to talk about the Trek leader Samkit - a great leader , keeps a eye on every trekker on physical fitness, constantly checks - if everything is okay , being helpful to the trekkers , when not feeling well, on few sites it was super cold and it was very hard to come out of tent and he was very helpful to reach out to trekkers directly into  the tent for daily check up. His strategy of moving fast and leading by example - by keep moving ahead in the trial helped us to be more quick and he was very clear on the rest time - that we shouldnt exceed them/waste our time. He was also very supportive of people taking enough pictures :)  I believe a leader must have some improvement points too :) - else he can become a hitler ( that was on a light note ) . On a serious note - Samkit could have engaged the participants in some fun games atleast twice or thrice in the entire trek time ( I know, it was a small group and he felt - we are very well connected, but with my last time KGL experience - I liked some of the unique nice games that you had palnned for trekkers, such kind of events/games will glorify the India hikes more and make it more unique ) .
Trek guide Harshid bhai , cooking staff and other supprotive staff were amazing , without their support - we couldnt have trekked in super hot, super cold, super rain, super windy and super snow weather..
I was really happy with the snow weather this time ( I felt sorry for our mule friends.. ). I would like to thank the nature god for it :) 
Btw Kinshuk and Suhas were amazing in supporting the trek during roopkund to KGL shifting.. even though it’s not a Indiahikes problem – they ensured , all trekkers get a nice trek experience and supported in all the ways.. This is one of the biggest reason – people like me chose India hikes.. you are responsible, consider all trekkers as your responsibility and support on all matters.. Thanks to all of you !!!

So to keep it short, yes i had the most memorable trek, food was good, staff were good, trek leader and every person did great job by taking care of all the trekkers to all those who were left behind or stuck in mud or stony patches they were there every time.
This was my first high altitude trek to Great Kashmir Lakes , and no doubt now i understood why is Kashmir called Heaven on earth ...I just witnessed it and am glad I took Indiahikes for this.
They put lot of sugar in morning black tea....plz tell them to keep it less....HAHAH
No complaints its us who had to adjust with the situation there in mountains. Indiahikes were best with every part of it.
Yes Indiahikes follow every protocol.
To that extent our trek leader Braham was too supportive for every trekker.
He took our health checkups at regular intervals, our oxy meter reading BP check, people who were on medicines, he personally took special care for them as well, weather they are having medicine on time or not.

The Trek was beyond our expectation. It is so beautiful that no words can imagine.  I was personally not feeling well due to ankle and knee pain . I got a tendon issue and heel spur in March this year. Everyone advised me to stay at home and take full rest . I waited patiently for months to recover and the pain was only interested in playing a Peek a Boo. I had planned for one more trek this year and I couldn't sit idle at home when my friends started planning for KGL. So I decided to go ahead and booked. I managed to do my routine Zumba , Yoga , Walks and Jogging . But when the date was getting closer , I lost my confidence as my heel started giving me pain again. But my friends encouraged me to go .  To be frank I had made alternate plans to do in Kashmir and I was thinking about cancelling KGL even when I was on my flight to Sri Nagar. But when I landed in Kashmir, I decided to give it a try.
I had severe headache on day 1 and I thought I'll have to return back .Our Trek Lead Vignesh is such a positive person and he was not ready to send me back . From day 2 on wards I felt much better . I could feel that mountains were healing me . I would like to thank our Guide Rahul. He was so helpful whenever I needed help. I am so happy to see Rahul lending his hand whenever I wanted a help. He was so friendly and true to his heart. I have seen how Rahul help the other trekkers who needed help to climb the boulders . Every other morning Rahul will come and ask if I am feeling fine. He is so empathetic . I am glad he is working with IH. 
Apart from slight ankle and knee pain during decent , I had no other major issues . And after all it was worth all those pain. The trek was amazingly beautiful . Every day I could sense a positive energy coming in and it was unbelievable for me that I did it ! 
Interesting part is, after all those days of long walk and tiring, now I am back to city to a normal life but I have no signs of Ankle Pain at all ! I don't know what miracle mountains did to me . I am so happy that I did it ! Thanks to IH

The trek leader and local guides were very helpful and made sure we could enjoy the nature more with all beautiful stories of there camaraderie with nature.

Ashish was so passionate and sincere about the Green and clean environment by picking up every plastic wrap (small or big) that came in contact to the eye. This is and will always remain an heartfelt efforts by Ashish. Manoj is a real asset to the team. Soft, pleasant and  his excellent skills in communicating stories is mesmerizing. Deboo is a professional Trekker having a great stamina and knowledge of the Local people and mountains is indeed gratifying.
The food was just too good and made us feel at home with simple but clean and tasty food. Moreover they ensured that the food served was hot. My sincere appreciation to each and everyone behind this show. We were served with Hot Ginger Tea after Dinner. This was like an icing with cherry on the cake. 
Such efforts makes us feel how genuine Indiahikes is towards it's trekkers welfare.
Kudos to all including Prathima. Her regular emails making me feel the importance of fitness did pay out. I quit smoking and was regular with my everyday walk of 4 to 6 kms daily with an average of 9.44 mts. per Kms.

The last day of the trek, when we were passing through the forest, made me very emotional. There was one point when I was far ahead of my group. The weather was beautiful- cold, not sunny. I could see the great mountains at a distance! And the forest was extremely beautiful. It was so beautiful that I hugged a nearby tree and was almost in tears! I felt sad that we humans consider ourselves to be the masters of this planet. So much so that our arrogance has caused the extinction of so many species and destruction of the forests and the habitats of countless animals. I mean we all read about it when we were small, but when you actually see it, you feel the emotion flowing in you! You feel as if you are the nature and empathize with it. 
Even while passing through the beautiful forest I saw several plastic wastes strewn on the way. This is one thing I will try to tell my friends and colleagues; to make them aware that we share this world with other species and that we have to respect the forests .That a swanky car and big house shouldn't be ones primary goal in life and that ensuring our planet remains clean and being responsible beings should be on ones top priorities. 
The trek was brilliant! Organized very well! No complaints at all. And adding to that the group was an amazing bunch of like minded people. We got along so well that we have become friends for life.
Mafia!!!! Even during my previous trek, Mafia game brought all of us together. This game actually makes us bond very well as a group! I am not sure if all the trek leads are instructed to ensure they make the group play this game because I have done two treks with Indiahikes and in both the treks (my first trek Pangarchulla and this one-KGL) I had the same trek lead - Aashay. And he ensured the game was introduced to the group. Once people started playing the game, Man o man! every one jumped in and the engagement was brilliant! I suggest India hikes make this a ritual in all their treks :D I can guarantee that this game can break the 'group-ism' which I have noticed during my treks. I feel group-ism is bad and that everyone should interact with everyone. And the game-Mafia is the best way :)

Firstly, a huge shout out to our trek leader on this trek Umesh, without whom I would not have completed this trek. Also, the entire crew, chefs, ghodawala, mules :D,trek guide and all in all Indiahikes.
Every single thing was organized so well right from the time we all met at the meeting point till the end.
Great trek mates who were in constant touch right from the time we were introduced over Whats app by our trek coordinator who motivated enough to get prepped for the trek, comfortable transportation to the base camp, clear instructions and guidance right from the beginning of the trek,cozy tent stay ,yummy food, clean toilets. 

Oh, BTW  the summit day was my Birthday and everybody wished me and made me feel really special. After reaching the base camp, we were given certificate for our achievement and lovely people at Indiahikes had prepared a cake for me and I celebrated my Birthday at 12000ft which was like a dream come true. Seriously, this was such a nice gesture . 
I commend and thank every single person working at India Hikes who makes sure every single member on the trek is taken care well and is safe throughout the trek. You guys Rock!!

Bhrigu lake trek couldn't have been more beautiful than what I experienced. It felt so beautiful being there in the mountains with cool winds blowing all the way. My first trek ever and I will remember it forever. No matter how much I describe it won't suffice in appreciating the beauty of the place. A major credit goes to Indiahikes of course for making it possible for me. I felt safe throughout the trek in spite of being the only girl.

It was an amazing experience. We couldn't reach the summit owing to the bad weather yet it was time well spent. The staff and the trek guides/ leads are both very good - polite, fun, interactive.. 
A big shootout to Dorjee, Sonam, Lopsang, Subhash and Prahlad. And the others if I've missed the names. ( I remember all of them, but some names are difficult to remember :) )
Feedback : To have a buffer day or two to attempt the summit again. It's disheartening to be preparing for the trek, managing leaves and not be able to make it due to weather conditions. Also discourages in prepping and going for difficult treks. Extra charges would be fine, but need to have the option. Else it feels like we gave up easily.

One request, do start more high altitude treks which is above 20000 FT which will be for only experienced trekkers of certain grade and experience. These treks should also be cost effective. To make it cost effective we can let the trekkers do some work and no need of so much convenience which you guys normally provide for other treks...Just safety is paramount.

713,Jaspal Singh Dhillon,2018-08-01,Kanamo Peak,"
The whole trekking experience was on another level, this time.
Dushyant, the TL, told us the first day itself , that this trek is all about acclimatisation and he was right throughout. I and my friends, had a bit of headache upon reaching Kibber but it subsided by the time we were ascending to Kanano Base Camp.
Upon reaching the base camp, we had to pitch the tents and it was another good learning experience for us. Everybody pitched in to help! Keeping the team size small meant that the staff (Bhupi, Prahlad, DorJ) and TL - Dushyant could watch out for all of us.
The acclimatisation walk in Kibber and KBC, were super helpful in gauging our own capacity to climb, to drink water regularly and to set our pace. Dushyant's tip about inhaling on one step and exhale on the other, was a pretty good one and I followed it to the summit. Dushyant I think, also took the right (maybe harsh) decisions to send back the unfit trekkers at the checkpoints.
There were two staff members, who came along with the last guy to reach the summit which again speaks of the dedication of the Indiahikes team. Way to go, guys, way to go !!! You've set some really high standards for other orgs, if they want to copy you. If I were to give you a one-line compliment, it would be, you are the Apple of Trekking in India :) Everything is smooth like hot butter on bread. On the way back to Kaza, we met Geet, who signed our certificates on the fly !! On the way back to Shimla, we got stuck in landslide near Changwo, and met couple of mountaineers. They asked if we trekked with Geet and Dushyant and had good words to speak for the two. You guys are famous !! (for the right reasons..)
The really good points:
1.Keeping the team size small and higher number of staff numbers
2.Excellent food throughout, I even got ginger-honey tea at KBC for my sore throat 
3.The TL - Dushyant, vibrant , knowledgeable and disciplined 
Maybe you could improve on this:
1.We (me and 4 friends of mine) came via Kinnaur route. We got stuck in a flash-flood near Schicling. The locals were ready to drop us in Kaza, but nobody knew IH and nobody know where to drop us at. Maybe, a helpline (BSNL number please!) in Kaza and name of homestay in Kaza, in the instructions itself would be helpful. We got hold of Kinshuk , the co-ordinator after a while but a local help is always welcome.
2.I had indicated online that no pickup is needed. I got called up at 5am in Pooh, asking where am I !! Thanks for your concern but it would be nice to either not ask online or confirm that the trekker is coming on his own beforehand 2-3 days ahead of trek.
3. Please do not ask trekkers to go for a run, take a screenshot and upload, just 2-3 days before the trek. It was a cause of some concern for my friends. Please remind or ask for the proof, 30 days, 15 days prior. Calling them up on phone and asking about physical activities, 3 days before a trek is to begin, is nothing short of an oral exam, reminds of the boards.

Especially like the idea of green-trails which implants the basic common sense of keeping the country clean. Thanks for the initiative. 
Awareness spread about AMS gave us heads up about the consequences that might be faced. Constant monitor of blood oxygen level helps in knowing how our body is adapting to the altitude changes.

The trek went well. Geet, our TL, Dorje and Bhupendar who were the lead and sweeper guides respectively and the entire staff(really sorry, I couldn't remember all names) were amazing. 
The things that didn't go well were 3 of the trekkers were sent down from KBC to Kibber, this was obviously due to them not putting enough preparation before the trek. Geet had to go down along with them until Kibber and came back which would be exhausting for any person no matter how fit. I wish if IH had a weekly fitness tracker that tracks the fitness routine atleast 3 weeks prior the trek so that the trekkers are well prepared before trek, atleast for treks that are  difficult. And having two TLs for a difficult trek is always good due for scenarios mentioned above.

721,Tanu Rana,2018-07-01,Valley Of Flowers,"
I did the Valley of flowers trek (22-27 July) with India hikes and I absolutely loved it. This was my first solo trek, it kicked off with conflicting nervousness and excitement and ended with a bit of despair of having to leave that place and its wonderful people behind. 
It was really amazing to witness this journey unwind, to watch a group of complete strangers turn into friends and pour their hearts out to each other about their deepest concerns in just a matter of few days. I completely credit this to all the efforts made by the India hikes team be it the trek leader or the local staff, they kept uniting everyone and persistently instilled the importance of ""team spirit"" in us, following which many of us while on the trek were actually looking out and waiting for others to catch up and trek together as a team. This was one of the best things about our trek, and was one of the top factors which truly distinguished the India hikes team from the other dispersed teams along the trails (whom I rarely found trekking as a ""team""). 
To state an instance many times we found ourselves so indulged in our profound conversations (with the fellow trekkers and the trek leader) during our trek that it actually diverted our minds from the tiresome trek and we actually paced up without even realizing or feeling it, this was one hell of a trick that I feel every trekker should exploit.
Furthermore, the trek leader and other staff members seemed really passionate about the Green Trails program and were educating others about it which was truly inspiring and the zeal was quite contagious (I felt like joining the green trails program hearing them, and am hoping to do so in the near future!). We tried to pick as much waste along the trails as we could find and I certainly feel that we left the mountains in a better condition than we found them in (but I do realize that there's still a long way to go, considering the amount of people trailing the mountains each day).
I greatly admire India Hikes for this initiative and wish you guys all the best for your future endeavors.
So in my experience India hikes (through their trek leaders and staff) doesn't just assist us in our treks but also helps every trekker be a better person by teaching them about caring for their environment as well as the people around them. These are really some great values that I learnt from my trek and will hope that I trek with India hikes soon again and learn many more worthy life lessons :)
Thanks for an unforgettable experience.

This was my first experience with India Hikes having been on trek to Himalayas with other trekking companies and it was a memorable experience. 
As you would be aware that we were originally to go to Tarsar Marsar but it was raining very heavily at our lidderwat camp site and the route to Tarsar was diverted to Satlanjan from where we visited Hindalsar and bikewas lakes.
It was really very commendable for the team to spontaneously come up with an alternate itinerary rather that calling off the batch which was appreciated by everyone in the group.
I was really very delighted to see the other side of the valley which is unexplored by many trekkers and i believe we were the lucky ones as there may be thousands of people who would have seen Tarsar Marsar but only a select few who have been to other side of it. Having said that i would definitely come back with a hope of visiting Tarsar Marsar one day 
Most of the things were really good and up to the mark such as food, tents, sleeping bags, trek lead and local guides. 
Only one suggestion ice breaker activities on the very first day will help trekkers to know each other better and interact better on the trail rather that doing them on the second day at the camp site

Dushyant was knowledgeable and professional throughout. He was quick to get a sense of how the group was doing and in reacting accordingly. After the first day, he suggested a few of the first-timers offload their backpacks to improve their experience. When one girl was struggling with what seemed like AMS symptoms, he immediately knew where he was needed most. All of his experience came to the fore when having to make difficult decisions like choosing to delay our start due to bad weather and choosing to stop while we were wet and cold because we had to eat. Dushyant's knowledge and ability to get the group to bond through games and songs elevated the overall experience.

The route was breath taking, with a good mix of varied terrain.
The Trek lead, Ashay was a perfect leader firm and encouraging always, ensures that everybody got the best out of the Trek irrespective of the trekker's level
Assistant lead, Heera,  was a like a mountain goat running up and down the retinue of trekkers, helping out.  He also identified several flowers, plants and trees and told us about them.
The guide,  Abdul chacha, was wise, knowledgeable and considerate. His ever smiling encouragement gave us a boost.
The kitchen staff were skilled and accommodating,. The food was delicious, and they cooked a special meal of gruel and kichdi for those experiencing a bout of delhi-belly
I would like to make a special mention of Roohi from sheikh tours.  I had booked a late  flight and consequently missed the slot for crossing the checkpost at Pahalgam,. She tried every possible contact to get us across on the same day, but when that turned futile, she put us up at a pretty neat and cosy homestay, reasonably priced and ensured that we were on the way at the crack of dawn the next day.  We made it in time :)

My first trek with Indiahikes was the most memorable experience of my life ! i am very thankful to the entire team for making this so wonderful, enjoyable and most unforgettable. 
1. Trek prep- i felt guided constantly by the emails from indiahikes. Mails, youtube videos with information about fitness and what to pack, how to pack etc was very helpful. It kept us motivated throughout in preparing for the trek. i downloaded the Nike run app and started my daily runs. It gave me a lot of information about my body, my fitness. i could feel the lack of stamina initially and with each week, i began to feel better...though there were also initial struggles with my calf muscles going sore and my knees hurting due to a fall etc. Overall, i could manage with it because i was happy and looking forward.
2. The trek - Arriving at Govind ghat and meeting the Indiahikes team and co- trekkers set our enthusiastic spirits soaring ! Rooms at Govind ghat were clean and satisfactory !
First day - Govind ghat to Ghangria - 10 kms - seemed wonderful and fun !
Second day - Ghangria to the valley of flowers - super fun !
Third day - Ghangria to hemkund - scenic, serene and overwhelming !
Last day - Ghangria to Govind Ghat- tiring but good. My toes were killing due to shoe bite so the last 2 kms i made it on bare foot. 
The whole trek experience with all the co- trekkers and indiahikes team made us feel like a family. Our trek leader Abhishek Negi was amazing. His constant motivation and inspiration with a splash of humor and  talent was admirable. Dhan Singh ji's support in helping us climb a big steep rock and letting us have our taste of adventure at valley of flowers is unforgettable.  Pratap ji's patience to wait for the slow trekkers is indeed very moving. i am grateful to all of them for making this experience so wholesome and unforgettable !
Post trek experience:  i have never felt this sad returning home after a trek. I sincerely hope to trek more in future with India hikes. Thank you

Tents and sleeping bags and the liners that Indiahikes provided in this trek was of good quality. I personally dint feel any issue with those. Even we have learnt how to pitch and unpitch the tents in this trek which was a n added advantage. :)

Food, arrival of off loading bags, kitchen staff, especially out TL, ATL and guide they were awesome. Geet and Soumitra made our trip really special. They were really supportive and they were very knowledgeable. Even though the trek was a difficult grade trek most of the times I didn't feel it to be too tiring because of Geet. We used to talk and walk through the terrain which made it feel very easy. By far he is the best TL I've ever got. Also he gave us technical information on how to use an oxygen cylinder, what medicines to use at what time, how to sleep in sleeping bag and how to pitch and unpitch the tents. These things helped us a lot in the trek. Overall the trek was very good and hope to come again. :)
Tents were very good, only on one camp site the zip was torn which they immediately fixed it. The outer cover of the tent was very good and none of the tents had any leakages or seeping of water was not seen. Sleeping bags were up to the expectations and we were given liners which were very good, the only thing was the sleeping bag covers were torn in few places, except that everything was cool.
I'd say its more than safe. Everyday oxy reading and the first day BP reading was taken. TL used to ask everyone about their health and medications ( about diamox and BP medications ) everyday. Every gear we used, let it be a trekking stick or a micro-spike it was of very good quality. I can't enough about the practices Indiahikes does. I guess its a very good practice to continue what you guys are doing.

It was an excellent trek. Very professionally conducted. I would give 4.5 out of 5.
The safety gears and protocols were good.
I am a Doctor. Hence I felt the trek leaders could have been taught a little more regarding health issues like dehydration, antibiotic usage and injectable medicines. None the less Geet had good knowledge and experience of handling important cases in his earlier treks.

Pros:
1. Pin Bhaba pass was very beautiful with noticeable change in landscapes everyday and the experience got better and better as we went towards Spiti.
2. Regular checking of our fitness levels and correct suggestions of what to expect and what to take for the trek was good.
3. TL- Geet was professional, extremely friendly, knowledgeable and funny. He was able to lift up all our spirits during the trek and at the camp site.
4. ATL- Saumithra was a perfect assistant to Geet. Friendly, witty, supportive and had great patience.
5. Guide- Subhash bhai was our superman and also our savior. He was great.
6. Food served was healthy, tasty and different everyday. One would never have expected to get gulab jamoon on one of the days.
7. Facilities like sleeping tents, toilet tents, dining tents were in good condition and camp sites were pitched in perfect location.
8. Attitude of all the trek mates was appreciable. 14 members in the group was perfect.
9. Concept of GT was good. It feels bad to see so many plastic wrappers and waste thrown in the mountains even in a trek which is not much explored.
10. Cost of the trek was reasonable.
11. The whole trek has been a motivation to me and also I would like to such similar treks frequently. I would also like to continue the fitness workout I was doing till now.
Cons: (very little)
1. Rental of trek shoes and bag was not done in spite of staying close to Indiahikes office. Hence had to spend some more money on them.

Just one suggestion - though i didnt take part in the last leg which was to Chandratal - wanted to inform you that the best time to visit Chandratal is early morning at 530 to get the perfect reflections instead of afternoon or evening- i wil be sending you snaps to show the difference 
In any trip the difference between a WOW and a nice- is marginal - but when you are ending a tiring trek and see something so wonderful as the early morning reflection of the snow capped mountains in the CHandratal lake - every single person would say - that Chandratal view in the early morning would be the highlight of the trip .

Absolutely loved everything about the trek: the trek leader, the briefing session, instructions given, the way the trek leaders never failed to look after each and every one of us, the food, the concept of green trails, the spirit of always being together and so many many more things to go on with. The trek on a personal level was absolutely an awesome experience with me. 
There is one small concern however, if the number of solo travelers are a little less in number and of group travelers are more, chances are that the socialising aspect becomes a little difficult because people tend to remain in their own comfortable circles. I had initially planned on coming solo for the trek and I couldn’t thank my friend enough for accompanying me for this trek because the groups that had come along were not very social. This is my personal feedback and could vary with my other trek mates. 
This issue hardly mattered towards the end since I was awestruck by the beauty of the trek itself.

The trek was simply amazing! 
We had expected heavy rains but to our surprise it didn’t rain throughout the trek. 
The entire team was very sportive and enthusiastic. 
The interaction sessions and the games that we were made to play was very fun and kept the trekkers entertained. 
To sum it all up, id say it was a great experience.

It was an out of this world experience. This was my first trek. I had gone through the given fitness regime but somehow wasnt able to acclimatize with the weather on high altitude. Therefore I decided to stay back at Rola Kholi camp site and could not trek on the summit day. Inspite of all these situations it was just simply amazing experience! Gourab, Tirath, Dolubhai, Vijaybhai, Pravinbhai and entire staff at the camp site was extremely supportive, caring and also taught me what to do and not to do in difficult times at high altitude. I made a mistake of not renting the trekking pole, but I am thankful to Gourab and Tirath, they gave me their trekking poles when I needed it the most. So all in all it was a great experince. I was able to enjoy the mountains more coz of the entire team.

Best of the Best Experience. Amazing time in the Mountains. Had never thought that getting away from the world would be so peaceful. No calls, No work, Just chill!!. Thanks to India Hikes for a wonderful memory and an unforgettable experience. Will keep coming for other treks every year. This has motivated me so much that I cannot think of any other place to go than mountains. Each and every spot of the trek is wordless.

To start with the trek was great. Had super fun with all the trek mates and my friends. Special thanks to Dr. Varun Sharma our trek leader, our guide Negi ji and Harish ji. They ensured that our trek was safe and enjoyable at the same time. Dr. Varun is an outstanding person and very helpful at the same time.
About the trek, this was my first Himalayan trek and I am glad I made the right choice by opting for Buran Ghati Trek. The trek is very beautiful right from the start point. Views on the way to Janglik are so beautiful and mesmerizing. The Buran Ghati trek has its share of peace, beauty, thrill and excitement. Base camps are setup at the most beautiful sites with river streams, snow-covered mountains, and greenery around. Hats off to India hikes team for providing us with a such thrilling and nerve cracking experience. The rappelling down experience from Buran Ghati pass was like a cherry on the top. The trek ends in an again a very beautiful village Barua. Awesome experience overall. Kudos to the entire Indiahikes team

This was the first time with India Hikes and I really appreciate their professionalism!
The trek lead Dr. Varun was very friendly, informative, and took good care during the whole time!
The lead guide Mr. Negi was amazing and always kept us on toes! He also enjoyed along with us by dancing and singing in the campsites!
Mr. Harish guided us at the rear end and was very patient and cooperative! Thanks to him for keeping with my pace at the very end!
All the support staff - cooks, porters, tech guys for rappelling, etc were just amazing human beings! Without them, it wouldn't have been possible!
All 21 of us completed the trek without any injury or sickness!

This being my first ever trek what kind or so was wonderful, Every sight that I took around was mesmerizing and awe-strucking. Thanks for making this rare trek available to us.
I would like to take this moment to specially and most importantly give all the praises and BIG THANK YOU to our trek guides both who was leading and who was at behind all throughout the trek. Mr. Negi and Mr. Harish. They did an awesome job by taking their time out of own lives and ensuring everyone are together and completing the trek easily and comfortably. There was No Rush and No Force to complete the trek. They were very supporting. Please give our regards to both of them. 
Also, I would like to thank all the kitchen staff at all the campsites, how wonderfully and heartfully they make great and awesome meals for us. Every day we were getting amazing food, hot water and what not by such hardworking and dedicating people in the kitchen. Dhaba's also don't give such food with all the facilities. And these guys are giving us such wonderful homemade food at such heights. AMAZING!!
And finally the trek leader and the porters who took our loads. Man, not an easy job what they do. The porters taking two bags on their backs and climbing up and down through rocks and snow without proper shoes and all, commendable. And the Trek leader, Varun for us. Thanks for giving him the opportunity to do this trek with us. Heard that it was also his first time trekking this Ghati or Pass. We were thankful for his presence so that we could share and have the experience for the first time. He did a really great job in handling the group and also he was never forceful or impatient on people. He was calm and waited on any health situation that occurred and handled it very well. All in all, very great journey with all the staff and guides in this trek throughout. The bond that was created so early with all of them was just wonderful. This group was really great, can't argue about it. We would love to do a trek again together as a group.

This was my first trek ever, so I might seem extra excited. But the trek was something you should get extra excited about. Right from the ride towards Janglik till Barua everything was so beautiful. You get to trek on almost all kinds of terrain. There were meadows, rocks, snow, rivers, lakes, waterfalls and what not. Rappelling & Snow slides were just the cherry on top. Fortunately, the weather was clear throughout the trek and a great group made the trek more enjoyable and comfortable. The campsites were beautiful as well as comfortable to live at. The food, tea and soup were very good and tasty. The desserts were exceptional and very delicious.( I literally kissed the hand of the cook Rahul). 
Coming to the team, the team leader (Varun Sharma), guide (Negi ji) & co guide (Ashish I think) were very co operative, friendly as well as knowledgeable. I have been with all three of them as I trekked in front, back and middle. They had a lot of patience(which is rare) and they were personally looking after each member of the group. I had a blister but it was well treated in the beginning itself due to which there was no major problem during my trek.
So to summarise, my experience was better than what I was expecting before the trek for the trek as well as IH team.
 
P.S. - The Green Trails initiative is very much appreciated.

Timely and accurate briefings ironed out potential apprehensions. Quiet, helpful and matured guide and sweeper inspired trust in care and safety. I tried but couldn't fault Indiahikes as a dependable trekking community organizer. Not the least, the group jelled well and never gave opportunities for reminders. In a nutshell, more or less a dream team combo.

Buran Ghati was my first trek ever, and it was a full package. Beautiful views around every turn on the trail. The trails varied in texture and difficulty levels which made it full of surprises. I've never been on any treks before and Buran Ghati has set the standard high. Right from the beautiful mountains down to meeting people from all different walks of life who came together to cross that pass and be one with nature was a lovely experience and I enjoyed every bit of it. I was most impressed by the kitchen staff and the porters for their efficiency and hard work. They silently worked in the background and put in the work to make our trekking experience richer. Kudos to them and their commitment.

This was my second high altitude trek with IH and it was another great experience. Buran Ghati is a beautiful trek and IH definitely made it more memorable. From the breathtaking views of Janglik, lushes of Dayara Bugyal, surreal Chandranahan lakes to the climax of the trek - the pass - nothing is going to escape my mind for the longest of time. It's really commendable how IH made the whole trek comfortable and safe, especially on the passing day. The equipment we used to rappel down the pass was of good quality and all necessary safety measures were taken by the IH technical staff.
Our trek leader didn't just led us though that beautiful terrain, he always kept our spirits up. The acclimatization walk at the first camp proved really beneficial and it made us more comfortable as we went higher up.
It was a blissful experience to trek with IH  which lived upto my experience and I look forward to have more of it.

Carrying the backpack and trekking made it challenging but all the mesmerizing views made it worth it all. It was my first experience with snow and I could not have asked for a better way to have it. The most humbling of it all was to watch the porters swiftly walk by while we huffed and puffed through the mountains. I had a great time being surrounded by beautiful mountains and like-minded people.

The whole program was well thought of, organised and planned. Food was  yummy and just what a trekker need at the right  time! The facilities at the campsite were above expectation. The only one thing that was a little disappointing was the end day. The trek ended very abruptly and everyone just dispersed as soon as we reached the last point. This was the last day of the trek and I just hoped there was just one more day or at least few more hours where the entire group had just enough time to  say Goodbyes!  Overall, great experience. Will definitely recommend  to  friends and family!
